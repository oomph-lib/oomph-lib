This document provides a brief introduction to the finite element method and illustrates how the method is implemented in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}. The first few sections present a brief, self-\/contained derivation of the method. The exposition is \char`\"{}constructive\char`\"{} and avoids a number of subtleties, which can be found in standard textbooks \mbox{[}e.\+g. E.\+B. Becker, G.\+F. Carey, and J.\+T. Oden. Finite Elements\+: An Introduction. Prentice-\/\+Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, (1981)\mbox{]} . We generally assume that all functions are sufficiently \char`\"{}well behaved\char`\"{} so that all mathematical manipulations \char`\"{}make sense\char`\"{}. Function spaces are only used where they help to make the notation more compact.

Readers who are familiar with the theory of finite elements may skip the introductory sections, but should consult the section \mbox{\hyperlink{index_towards_oo}{An object-\/oriented implementation}} which explains the particular implementation used in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}.

Initially, we develop the method for scalar second-\/order (elliptic) PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions, using classical 1D and 2D Poisson problems as model problems. Specifically, we consider the 1D problem \[ \frac{\mbox{d}^2 u(x)}{\mbox{d} x^2} = f(x) \mbox{ \ \ \ \ for $x\in[0,1]$ \ \ \ subject to \ \ \ } u(x=0)= g_0 \mbox{\ \ \ and \ \ \ } u(x=1)= g_1, \mbox{\hspace{3cm}} \] where $ f(x)$ and the constants $g_0$ and $g_1$ are given. The 2D equivalent is given by \[ \frac{\partial^2 u(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_1^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2} u(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_2^{2}} = f(x_1,x_2) \mbox{ \ \ \ \ for $(x_1,x_2)\in D$ \ \ \ subject to \ \ \ } u|_{\partial D} = g, \mbox{\hspace{5cm}} \] where $ f(x_1,x_2)$ and $ g(x_1,x_2)$ are given.

 Throughout this document, we use index notation and write, e.\+g., $ u(x_1,x_2) $ as $ u(x_i) $. We do not explicitly state the range of free indices where it is clear from the context -- in the above example it would be equal to the spatial dimension of the problem.

All mathematical derivations are presented using the \char`\"{}natural\char`\"{} numbering of the indices\+: e.\+g., the components of the 3D vector ${\bf f}$ are $ f_1, f_2 $ and $ f_3 $. Unfortunately, this notation is inconsistent with the implementation of vectors (and most other standard \char`\"{}containers\char`\"{}) in C++ where the indices start from 0 and the components of {\ttfamily vector$<$double$>$} {\ttfamily f(3)} are {\ttfamily f}\mbox{[}0\mbox{]}, {\ttfamily f}\mbox{[}1\mbox{]} and {\ttfamily f}\mbox{[}2\mbox{]}. There is no elegant way to resolve this conflict. Adopting C++-\/style numbering in the theoretical development would make the mathematics look very odd (try it!); conversely, adopting the \char`\"{}natural\char`\"{} numbering when discussing the C++-\/implementation would make this documentation inconsistent with the actual implementation. We therefore use both numbering systems, each within their appropriate context.    \\\cline{1-1}

Physically, the Poisson equation describes steady diffusion processes. For instance, the 2D Poisson problem describes the temperature distribution $u(x_i) $ within a 2D body, $D$, whose boundary $\partial D$ is maintained at a prescribed temperature, $ g(x_i)$. The function $ f(x_i)$ describes the strength of (distributed) heat sources in the body. In practical applications, the strength of these heat sources is bounded because no physical process can release infinite amounts of energy in a finite domain. Hence, we assume that \[ \int_D f(x_i) \ dx_1 dx_2 < \infty. \]

We usually write all PDEs in \char`\"{}residual form\char`\"{}, obtained by moving all terms to the left-\/hand-\/side of the equation, so that the general second-\/order scalar PDE problem is

\hypertarget{index_weaksoln}{}\doxysubsection{The weak solution}\label{index_weaksoln}
A classical (or strong) solution of the problem P is any function $ u(x_i) $ that satisfies the PDE and boundary condition at every point in $ D$, \[ {\cal R}(x_i; u(x_i)) \equiv 0 \ \ \ \forall x_i \in D \mbox{\ \ \ \ and \ \ \ \ } u|_{\partial D} = g. \] The concept of a \char`\"{}weak\char`\"{} solution is based on a slight relaxation of this criterion. A weak solution, $u_w(x_i), $ of problem P is any function that satisfies the essential boundary condition, \[ u_w|_{\partial D} = g, \] and for which the so-\/called \char`\"{}weighted residual\char`\"{} \[ r = \int_{D} {\cal R}(x_i; u_w(x_i)) \ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1) \] vanishes for {\itshape any} \char`\"{}test function\char`\"{} $ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) $ which satisfies homogeneous boundary conditions so that \[ \phi^{(test)}|_{\partial D} = 0. \]

At this point it might appear that we have fatally weakened the concept of a solution. If we only require the PDE to be satisfied in an average sense, couldn\textquotesingle{}t any function ~\newline
 be a \char`\"{}solution\char`\"{}? In fact, this is not the case and we shall now demonstrate that, for all practical purposes \mbox{[}we refer to the standard literature for a rigorous derivation\mbox{]}, the statement \[ \mbox{ "weak solutions are strong solutions" } \] is true. The crucial observation is that the weak solution requires the weighted residual to vanish for {\itshape any} test function. To show that this is equivalent to demanding that $ {\cal R} \equiv 0 \ \ \forall x_i \in D $ (as in the definition of the strong solution), let us try to construct a counter-\/example for which $ {\cal R} \not\equiv 0 $ in some part of the domain (implying that the candidate solution is not a classical solution) while $r=0$ (so that it qualifies as a weak solution). For simplicity we illustrate the impossibility of this in a 1D example. First consider a candidate solution $ u_c(x)$ which satisfies the essential boundary condition but does not satisfy the PDE anywhere, and that $ {\cal R}(x; u_c(x)) > 0 $ throughout the domain, as indicated in this sketch\+:  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{weaksoln1}
\doxyfigcaption{Residual (blue/solid) is nonzero (and positive) throughout the domain. A constant test function (red/dotted) is sufficient to show that the candidate solution is not a weak solution. }
\end{DoxyImage}
 Could this candidate solution possibly qualify as a weak solution? No, using the trivial test function $ \phi^{(test)} \equiv 1 $ gives a nonzero weighted residual, and it follows that $ {\cal R}(x, u_c(x)) $ must have zero average if $ u_c(x) $ is to qualify as a weak solution.

The figure below shows the residual for a more sophisticated candidate solution which satisfies the PDE over most of the domain.  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{weaksoln2}
\doxyfigcaption{Residual (blue/solid) is nonzero only in two small sub-\/domains. A suitably constructed test function with finite support (red/dotted) is sufficient to show that the candidate solution is not a weak solution. }
\end{DoxyImage}
 The residual is nonzero only in two small subdomains, $ D_1$ and $ D_2 $. The candidate solution is such that the residual has different signs in $ D_1$ and $ D_2 $ so that its average over the domain is zero. Could this solution qualify as a weak solution? Again the answer is no because we can choose a test function that is nonzero in only one of the two subdomains (e.\+g. the function shown by the red/dotted line), which gives a nonzero weighted residual.

It is clear that such a procedure may be used to obtain a nonzero weighted residual whenever the residual $ {\cal R} $ is nonzero {\itshape anywhere} in the domain. In other words, a weak solution is a strong solution, as claimed. \mbox{[}To make this argument mathematically rigorous, we would have to re-\/assess the argument for (pathological) cases in which the residual is nonzero only at finite number of points, etc.\mbox{]}.

\hypertarget{index_int_by_parts_1}{}\doxysubsection{A useful trick\+: Integration by parts}\label{index_int_by_parts_1}
Consider now the weak form of the 2D Poisson problem P2, \[ \int_D \left( \sum_{j=1}^2 \frac{\partial^2 u(x_i)}{\partial x_j^2} - f(x_i) \right) \phi^{(test)}(x_i) \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 =0 \mbox{\ \ \ \ subject to\ \ \ \ } u|_{\partial D}=g. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2) \] After integration by parts and use of the divergence theorem, we obtain \[ \int_D \sum_{j=1}^2 \frac{\partial u(x_i)}{\partial x_j} \ \frac{\partial \phi^{(test)}(x_i)}{\partial x_j} \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 + \int_D f(x_i) \ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 = \oint_{\partial D} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} \ \phi^{(test)} \ \mbox{d}s, \ \ \ \ \ (3) \] where $s$ is the arclength along the domain boundary $ \partial D$ and $ \partial/\partial n$ the outward normal derivative. Since the test functions satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions, $ \left. \phi^{(test)} \right|_{\partial D} = 0, $ the line integral on the RHS of equation (3) vanishes. Therefore, an alternative version of the weak form of problem P2 is given by \[ \int_D \sum_{j=1}^2 \frac{\partial u(x_i)}{\partial x_j} \ \frac{\partial \phi^{(test)}(x_i)}{\partial x_j} \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 + \int_D f(x_i) \ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 = 0. \ \ \ \ \ \ (4) \] We note that (4) involves first derivatives of the unknown function $ u $ and the test function $ \phi^{(test)} $, whereas (2) involves second derivatives of $ u $ and the zero-\/th derivatives of $ \phi^{(test)} $. The advantages of using the \char`\"{}symmetric\char`\"{}, integrated-\/by-\/parts version of the weak form will become apparent in the subsequent sections.

\hypertarget{index_function_spaces}{}\doxysubsection{\mbox{[}\+Nearly an aside\+:\mbox{]} Function spaces}\label{index_function_spaces}
We stated in the introduction that all functions are assumed to be {\itshape  sufficiently \char`\"{}well-\/behaved\char`\"{} so that all mathematical manipulations \char`\"{}make sense\char`\"{}}. It is important to realise that we have already (tacitly) used this assumption in the derivation of the weak form. The weak form does not \char`\"{}make sense\char`\"{} if we allow candidate solutions and test functions for which the integral in (1) does not exist. This imposes restrictions on the types of functions that are \char`\"{}admissible\char`\"{} in our problem. The precise form of these restrictions depends on the form of the residual ${\cal R}(x_i,u(x_i))$, and, typically, the restrictions are related to the functions\textquotesingle{} differentiability. It is convenient to employ the concept of a \char`\"{}function space\char`\"{} to collectively refer to all functions that satisfy the required restrictions. \mbox{[}In this introduction, none of the additional (heavy) machinery from functional analysis is required\mbox{]}.

For instance, we can ensure that the integrated-\/by-\/parts version of problem P2 in equation (4) \char`\"{}makes sense\char`\"{} if we restrict $u(x_i)$ and $\phi^{(test)}(x_i)$ to all functions whose zeroth and first derivatives are square integrable over the domain $D$. These functions are members of a (well-\/known) function space that is usually denoted by $H^{1}(D)$. In fact, $H^{1}(D)$ is a particular instance of a family of function spaces -- the Sobolev spaces $H^{i}(D)$ where $i=0,1,2,...$ which contain all functions whose zeroth, first, ..., i-\/th derivatives are square-\/integrable over the domain $D$. The members of these function spaces have the property that \[ u(x_i) \in H^0(D) \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \int_D u^2(x_i) \ dx_1 dx_2 < \infty, \] \[ u(x_i) \in H^1(D) \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \int_D \left( u^2(x_i) + \sum_{j=1}^2 \left(\frac{\partial u(x_i)}{\partial x_j}\right)^2 \right) dx_1 dx_2 < \infty, \] etc. We use the subscript \char`\"{}0\char`\"{} to restrict a given function space to the subset of its members which vanish on the domain boundary $ \partial D,$ \[ u(x_i) \in H^i_0(D) \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \ u(x_i) \in H^i(D) \mbox{\ \ \ and \ \ \ } u|{\partial D}=0. \]

Using these function spaces, we can provide a concise definition of the weak form of problem P2\+: \begin{center} \tabulinesep=1mm

It is important to realise that the choice of suitable function spaces for $u(x_i)$ and $\phi^{(test)}(x_i)$ is problem-\/dependent, ~\newline
 guided by the inspection of the weak form for a specific problem. The (pragmatic) procedure is straightforward\+: write down the weak form and determine the (minimal) constraints that must be imposed on $u(x_i)$ and $\phi(x_i)$ for the weak form to \char`\"{}make sense\char`\"{}. All functions that satisfy these constraints, are \char`\"{}admissible\char`\"{} and, collectively, they form a function space $ H(D) $, say. The weak form of the general problem P can then be written as ~\newline

 \mbox{[}If you followed the above argument carefully you will have realised that our strategy for ensuring that the weak form \char`\"{}makes sense\char`\"{} uses a sufficient rather than a necessary condition. For instance, it is not necessary for $ u(x_i)$ and $ \phi^{(test)}(x_i)$ to be members of the same function space. Alternative formulations are possible but we shall not pursue such ideas any further in this introduction.\mbox{]}

\hypertarget{index_galerkin}{}\doxysubsection{The Galerkin method}\label{index_galerkin}
We now exploit the definition of the weak solution to develop a numerical method that can be used to determine approximate solutions to problem P\textsubscript{weak}. We start by splitting the solution into two parts, \[ u(x_i) = u_{h}(x_i) + u_{p}(x_i), \] where $ u_{p}(x_i)$ is an (arbitrary) function that satisfies the Dirichlet boundary conditions, \[ u_{p}|_{\partial D} = g. \] The unknown function $ u_{h}(x_i) $ then has to satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions \[ u_{h}|_{\partial D} = 0.\] We expand $ u_{h}(x_i) $ in terms of a (given) infinite set of basis functions $ \psi_j(x_i) \in H_0(D) \ \ \ (j=1,...,\infty) $, \[ u(x_i) = u_{p}(x_i) + \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} U_j \psi_j(x_i), \ \ \ \ \ \ (5) \] which discretises the problem because the solution is now determined by the (as yet unknown) discrete coefficients $ U_j \ \ \ (j=1,...,\infty). $ There are many possible sets of basis functions\+: polynomials, trigonometric functions, systems of eigenfunctions; mathematically speaking, the only requirement is that the basis functions are sufficiently general that the solution can be represented by the expansion (5). In other words, the functions must be a complete basis for $H_0(D)$.

How do we determine the discrete coefficients $ U_j $? Inserting the expansion for $u(x)$ into the definition of the weighted residual yields \[ r = \int_{D} {\cal R}\left(x_i; \ u_{p}(x_i)+\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} U_j \psi_j(x_i)\right) \ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 = 0, \ \ \ \ \ \ (6) \] and we recall that this equation must be satisfied for {\itshape any} test function $ \phi^{(test)} \in H_0(D) $. The functions $\psi_j(x_i)$ form a complete basis for $ H_0(D)$, and so all possible test functions $ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) $ may be represented as \[ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \Phi_k \psi_k(x_i). \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (7) \] Thus, the condition \[ \mbox{...for any basis function $ \phi^{(test)}(x_i) $...} \] becomes \[ \mbox{...for any values of the coefficients $ \Phi_k$...} \] Inserting the expansion (7) into the definition of the weak solution (6) yields \[ r = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \Phi_k \ r_k(U_1, U_2,...) = 0, \ \ \ \ \ (8) \] where \[ r_k(U_1, U_2,...) = \int_{D} {\cal R}\left(x_i; \ u_{p}(x_i)+\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} U_j \psi_j(x_i)\right) \ \psi_k(x_i) \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (9) \] Equation (8) must hold for {\itshape any} value of the coefficients $ \Phi_k $, so the coefficients $ U_j $ must satisfy the equations \[ r_k(U_1, U_2,...) = 0, \mbox{ \ \ \ \ for } k=1,2,... \]

In practice, we truncate the expansions (5) and (7) after a finite number of terms to obtain the approximations (indicated by tildes) \[ \widetilde{u}(x_i) = u_p(x_i) + \sum_{j=1}^{M} U_j \psi_j(x_i) \mbox{ \ \ and \ \ } \widetilde{\phi^{(test)}}(x_i) = \sum_{k=1}^{M} \Phi_k \psi_k(x_i), \ \ \ \ \ \ (10) \] and we determine the $M$ unknown coefficients, $U_1,...,U_M$, from the $M$ algebraic equations \[ r_k(U_1,...,U_M)=0, \mbox{\ \ where \ \ $k=1,...,M$}. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (11) \] The number of terms in each truncated expansion must be the same, so that we obtain $M$ equations for $M$ unknowns.

The truncation of the expansions (5) and (7) introduces two approximations\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The approximate solution $ \widetilde{u}(x_i) $ is a member of the finite-\/dimensional function space $\widetilde{H}(D) \subset H(D)$ spanned by the basis functions included in the expansion (10).
\item We \char`\"{}test\char`\"{} the solution with functions from $ \widetilde{H_{0}}(D) $ rather than with \char`\"{}all\char`\"{} functions $ \phi^{(test)} \in H_0(D). $
\end{DoxyItemize}$\widetilde{H}(D) \to H(D)$ as $M \to \infty$, however, so the approximate solution $\widetilde{u}(x_i)$ converges to the exact solution $u(x_i)$ as we include more and more terms in the expansion. \mbox{[}The precise definition of \char`\"{}convergence\char`\"{} requires the introduction of a norm, which allows us to measure the \char`\"{}difference\char`\"{} between two functions. We refer to the standard literature for a more detailed discussion of this issue.\mbox{]}

In general, the equations $r_k(U_1,...,U_M)$ are nonlinear and must be solved by an iterative method such as Newton\textquotesingle{}s method. Consult your favourite numerical analysis textbook (if you can\textquotesingle{}t think of one, have a look through chapter 9 in Press, W. H.; Flannery, B. P.; Teukolsky, S. A.; and Vetterling, W. T. \char`\"{}\+Numerical Recipes in C++. \+The Art of Scientific Computing\char`\"{}, Cambridge University Press) for a reminder of how (and why) Newton\textquotesingle{}s method works. The following algorithm shows the method applied to our equations\+:

\Hypertarget{index_Newton}%
 \begin{center} {\bfseries{ Algorithm 1\+: Newton\textquotesingle{}s method }} \end{center} 


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Set the iteration counter $i=0$ and provide an initial approximation for the unknowns, $ U^{(0)}_j\ \ (j=1,..,M)$.
\item Evaluate the residuals \[ r_k^{(i)} = r_k\left( U^{(i)}_1,..., U^{(i)}_M\right) \mbox{\ \ \ for $k=1,...,M$}. \]
\item Compute a suitable norm of the residual vector (e.\+g. the maximum norm). If the norm is less than some pre-\/assigned tolerance, stop and and accept $U_j^{(i)} (j=1,...,M) $ as the solution.
\item Compute the Jacobian matrix \[ J_{kj} = \left. \frac{\partial r_k}{\partial U_j} \right|_{\left( U^{(i)}_1,..., U^{(i)}_M\right)} \mbox{\ \ \ for $j,k=1,...,M$}.\]
\item Solve the linear system \[ \sum_{j=1}^{M} J_{kj} \ \delta U_j = - r_k^{(i)} \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ \ where $k=1,...,M$} \] for $ \delta U_{j} \ \ ($j=1,...,M$).$
\item Compute an improved approximation via \[ U_j^{(i+1)} = U_j^{(i)} + \delta U_j \mbox{\ \ \ for $j=1,...,M$}. \]~\newline

\item Set $ i=i+1$ and go to 2.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}For a \char`\"{}good\char`\"{} initial approximation, $ U^{(0)}_j$, Newton\textquotesingle{}s method converges quadratically towards the exact solution. Furthermore, for linear problems, Newton\textquotesingle{}s method provides the exact solution (modulo any roundoff errors that might be introduced during the solution of the linear system) in a single iteration. Newton\textquotesingle{}s method can, therefore, be used as a robust, general-\/purpose solver, if (!) a good initial guess for the solution can be provided. In practice, this is not a serious restriction, because good initial guesses can often be generated by continuation methods. In {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}, Newton\textquotesingle{}s method is the default nonlinear solver.

Let us, briefly, examine the cost of the non-\/trivial steps involved in Newton\textquotesingle{}s method\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Step 2 requires the evaluation of $M$ integrals over the domain to determine the discrete residuals $ r_k^{(i)} $ from (9). (We note that, in general, the integrals must be evaluated numerically.)
\item Step 3 requires the computation of $M^2$ entries in the Jacobian matrix, each an integral of the form \[ J_{kj} = \int_{D} \frac{\partial }{\partial U_j} {\cal R}\left(x_i; \ \sum_{j=1}^{M} U_j \psi_j(x_i)\right) \ \psi_k(x_i) \ \mbox{d}x_1 \mbox{d}x_2 \mbox{\ \ \ for $j,k=1,...,M$.} \]
\item Step 4 requires the solution of a $M \times M$ linear system.
\end{DoxyItemize}In general, steps 3 and 4 will be very costly if $M$ is large. However, if the domain has a simple shape and the differential operator has a sufficiently simple structure, it is often possible to choose basis functions with suitable orthogonality properties that render the Jacobian matrix $J_{kj}$ sparse. As an example, we consider the application of Galerkin\textquotesingle{}s method in the 1D Poisson problem P1\+:

Inspection of the weak form shows that the choice $H(D) = H^1(D) $ is sufficient to ensure the existence of the integral. Of course, the \char`\"{}higher\char`\"{} Sobolev spaces $ H^2(D), H^3(D), ... $ would also ensure the existence of the integral but would impose unnecessary additional restrictions on our functions.

Next, we need to construct a function $u_p(x)$ that satisfies the Dirichlet boundary conditions. In 1D this is trivial, and the simplest option is the function $ u_p(x)=g_0+ (g_1-g_0) x$, which interpolates linearly between the two boundary values. Since $ \mbox{d}u_p(x)/ \mbox{d} x = g_1-g_0$, the discrete residuals are given by \[ r_k(U_1,U_2,...,U_M) = \int_0^1 \left[ \left( (g_1 - g_0) + \sum_{j=1}^{M} U_j \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \right) \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} + f(x) \ \psi_k(x) \right] \ \mbox{d}x \mbox{\ \ for $k=1,..,M$}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (12) \] and the Jacobian matrix has the form \[ J_{kj} = \int_0^1 \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ \mbox{d}x \mbox{\ \ for $j,k=1,..,M$}. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (13) \] The (Fourier) basis functions \[ \psi_j(x) = \sin\left(\pi j x \right)\] are a suitable basis because
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item they satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions,
\item they and their derivatives are square integrable, allowing all integrals to be evaluated, and
\item they are a complete basis for $ H^1_0(D)$.
\end{DoxyItemize}Furthermore, the orthogonality relation \[ \int_0^1 \cos\left(\pi k x\right) \cos\left(\pi j x\right) dx = 0 \mbox{\ \ \ for \ } j\ne k \] implies that the Jacobian matrix is a diagonal matrix, which is cheap to assemble and invert. Indeed, the assembly of the Jacobian matrix in step 4, and the solution of the linear system in step 5 have an \char`\"{}optimal\char`\"{} computational complexity\+: their cost increases linearly with the number of unknowns in the problem.

Unfortunately, the application of the method becomes difficult, if not impossible, in cases where the differential operators have a more complicated structure, and/or the domain has a more complicated shape. The task of finding a complete set of basis functions that vanish on the domain boundary in an arbitrarily-\/shaped, higher-\/dimensional domain is nontrivial. Furthermore, for a complicated differential operator, it will be extremely difficult to find a system of basis functions for which the Jacobian matrix has a sparse structure. If the matrix is dense, the assembly and solution of the linear system in steps 4 and 5 of Newton\textquotesingle{}s method can become prohibitively expensive.

Let us briefly return to the two versions of the weak form and examine the equations that we would have obtained had we applied Galerkin\textquotesingle{}s method to the original form of the weak equations, \[ \int_0^1 \left( \frac{\mbox{d}^2 u(x)}{\mbox{d}x^2} \ - f(x) \right) \phi^{(test)}(x) \ \mbox{d}x = 0. \] The discrete residuals are then given by \[ r_k = \int_0^1 \left( \sum_{j=1}^{M} U_{j} \frac{\mbox{d}^2 \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x^2} - f(x) \right) \psi_k(x) \ \mbox{d}x = 0, \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ \ for $k=1,...,M.$\ \ \ \ \ \ } (14) \] and the Jacobian matrix has the form \[ J_{kj} = \int_0^1\frac{\mbox{d}^2 \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x^2} \ \psi_k(x)\ \mbox{d}x. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (15) \]
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The restrictions that must be imposed on the basis functions, $ \psi_j(x) $, if (14) is to \char`\"{}make sense\char`\"{} are much more awkward than for the symmetric form for the problem; the product of their zeroth and second derivatives must be integrable over the domain.
\item The Jacobian matrix (13) that arises from the symmetric form of the weak problem is symmetric for {\itshape any} choice of basis functions whereas the Jacobian matrix (15) that arises from the original form is symmetric only for certain types of basis functions. This is not only advantageous for the solution of the linear system (only a fraction of the entries in the matrix need to be computed, and (more efficient) linear solvers that exploit the symmetry of the matrix can be used), but also properly reflects the symmetry in the (self-\/adjoint!) ODE.

\hypertarget{index_fe_basis_fct}{}\doxysubsection{Finite Element shape functions}\label{index_fe_basis_fct}
The key feature of the finite element method is that the basis functions have finite support, being zero over most of the domain, and have the same functional form. We illustrate the idea and its implementation for the 1D Poisson problem P1 in its symmetric (integrated-\/by-\/parts) form\+:

\[ r_k = \int_0^1 \left\{ \left( \frac{\mbox{d} u_p(x)}{\mbox{d} x} +\sum_{j=1}^{M} U_{j} \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \right) \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} + f(x) \ \psi_k(x) \right\} \mbox{d}x =0, \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ \ for $k=1,...,M.$}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ (16) \] The integral (16) exists for all basis functions $ \psi_j(x)$ whose first derivatives are square integrable; a class of functions that includes piecewise linear functions. ~\newline


We shall now construct a particular set of piecewise linear basis functions --- the (global) linear finite-\/element shape functions, often known as \char`\"{}hat functions\char`\"{}. For this purpose, we introduce $N$ equally-\/spaced \char`\"{}nodes\char`\"{} into the domain $ x \in [0,1]$; node $j$ is located at $X_j = (j-1) h $, where $h=1/(N-1)$ is the distance between the nodes. The (global) linear finite-\/element shape functions are defined by \[ \psi_j(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0 & \mbox{\ \ \ for $x < X_{j-1}$} \\ \frac{x-X_{j-1}}{X_j-X_{j-1}} & \mbox{\ \ \ for $ X_{j-1} <x < X_j$} \\ \frac{X_{j+1}-x}{X_{j+1}-X_j} & \mbox{\ \ \ for $ X_{j} <x < X_{j+1}$} \\ 0 & \mbox{\ \ \ for $x > X_{j+1}$} \\ \end{array} \right. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (17) \] and are illustrated below\+:

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{1Dmesh_with_linear_shape_fcts}
\doxyfigcaption{The (global) linear finite-\/element shape functions in 1D. }
\end{DoxyImage}
 The finite-\/element shape functions have finite support; in particular, the function $ \psi_j(x) $ is nonzero only in the vicinity of node j and varies linearly between one (at node j) and zero (at nodes $ j-1 $ and $ j+1 $). Furthermore, the shape functions satisfy the \char`\"{}interpolation condition\char`\"{} \[ \psi_j(X_i) = \delta_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{c} 1, \mbox{ if } i=j,\\ 0, \mbox{ if } i\neq j, \end{array}\right. \] where $ \delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. ~\newline
 The coefficients $V_j$ in an expansion of the form \[ \tilde{v}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} V_j \ \psi_j(x)\] have a straightforward interpretation\+: $V_j$ is the value of the function $ v(x) $ at node $ j $. The global shape functions vary linearly between the nodes, and so $ \tilde{v}(x) $ provides piecewise linear interpolation between the `nodal values' $V_j$.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fe_is_interpolant}
\doxyfigcaption{The superposition of the (global) linear finite-\/element shape functions provides a piecewise linear interpolation between the \`{}nodal values\textquotesingle{}. }
\end{DoxyImage}


Why are these shape functions useful in the Galerkin method? Consider the requirements listed at the beginning of this section\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It is easy to construct a function $ u_p(x) $ that satisfies the essential boundary conditions by choosing \[ u_p(x) = g_0 \psi_1(x) + g_1 \psi_N(x), \] where $ \psi_1(x) $ and $ \psi_N(x) $ are the global finite-\/element shape functions associated with the two boundary nodes, $1$ and $N$.
\item Regarding the requirements on the basis functions\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The global finite-\/element shape functions $ \psi_j(x) $ and their first derivatives are square integrable. Hence, the finite-\/dimensional function space $ H^1_{0,FEM}(D) $ spanned by the basis functions $ \psi_j(x) \ \ (j=2,...,N-1)$, associated with the internal nodes, is a subset of $ H^1_0,$ as required. Furthermore, it is easy to show that \[ \left| v(x) - \sum_{j=2}^{N-1} v(X_j) \psi_j(x) \right| \to 0 \mbox{\ \ \ as $N\to\infty$ and $h=\frac{1}{N-1} \to 0,$ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (18) } \] for any $ v(x) \in H^1_0(D) $. In other words, $ H^1_{0,FEM}(D) $ approaches $ H^1_0(D) $ as $ N \to \infty. $
\item The global finite-\/element shape functions $ \psi_2(x), \psi_3(x),...,\psi_{N-1}(x) $ vanish on the domain boundary.
\item The Jacobian matrix is sparse because its entries \[ J_{kj} = \frac{\partial r_k}{\partial U_j} = \int_0^1 \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \, \mbox{d}x \] are nonzero when the basis functions $ \psi_j(x) $ and $ \psi_k(x) $ are both non-\/zero. For these shape functions, \[ J_{kj} \ne 0 \mbox{\ \ \ \ when \ \ $k=j-1,\ j, \ j+1,$} \] indicating that the Jacobian matrix is tri-\/diagonal.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

We can now formulate the finite-\/element-\/based solution of problem P1 in the following algorithm\+: \begin{center} {\bfseries{ Algorithm 2\+: Finite Element solution of problem P1 by Newton\textquotesingle{}s method}} \end{center} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Choose the number of nodal points, $ N $, and distribute them evenly through the domain so that $ X_j=(j-1)h$, where $h=1/(N-1)$. This defines the global shape functions $ \psi_j(x)$.
\item Set \[ u_p(x) = g_0 \psi_1(x) + g_1 \psi_N(x) \] and \[ u_h(x) = \sum_{j=2}^{N-1} U_{j}\ \psi_j(x). \]
\item Provide an initial guess for the unknowns $ U_2,U_3,...,U_{N-1}$. Since P1 is a linear problem, the quality of the initial guess is irrelevant and we can simply set $ U_i^{(0)}=0 \mbox{\ \ \ for $i=2,...,N-1$}. $
\item Determine the residuals \[ r_k^{(0)} = \int_0^1 \left\{ \left( g_0 \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_1(x)}{\mbox{d} x} + \ g_1 \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_N(x)}{\mbox{d} x} + \ \sum_{j=2}^{N-1} U_{j}^{(0)}\frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \right) \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x}\ + f(x) \ \psi_k(x) \right\} \mbox{d}x \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ \ for $k=2,...,N-1,$} \] and the entries in the Jacobian matrix \[ J_{kj} = \frac{\partial r_k}{\partial U_j} = \int_0^1 \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ dx \mbox{\ \ \ for $j,k=2,...,N-1.$} \]
\item Solve the linear system \[ \sum_{j=2}^{N-1} J_{kj} \ \delta U_j = - r_k^{(0)} \mbox{\ \ \ for $k=2,...,N-1.$} \] for $ \delta U_k \ (k=2,...,N-1) $ .
\item Correct the initial guess via \[ U_j = U_j^{(0)} + \ \delta U_j \mbox{\ \ \ for $j=2,...,N-1.$} \] P1 is a linear problem, so $ U_j \ (j=2,...,N-1) $ is the exact solution. For nonlinear problems, we would have to continue the \mbox{\hyperlink{index_Newton}{Newton}} iteration until the residuals $ r_k(U_2,...,U_{N-1}) \ (k=2,...,N-1) $ were sufficiently small.
\item The finite-\/element solution is \[ u^{(FE)}(x) = g_0 \psi_1(x)+ g_1 \psi_N(x) + \sum_{j=2}^{N-1} U_j \psi_j(x) \ \ \ \ \ (19) \]~\newline

\hypertarget{index_non_uniform}{}\doxysubsection{Improving the quality of the solution\+: non-\/uniformly spaced nodes and higher-\/order shape functions}\label{index_non_uniform}
Algorithm 2 presents the simplest possible implementation of the finite element method for problem P1. We now discuss two straightforward extensions that can significantly improve the quality of the approximate solution.

The finite-\/element approximation in the previous section is piecewise linear between the nodal values. The accuracy to which the exact solution can be represented by a piecewise linear interpolant is limited by the number of nodal points, which is the essence of the convergence statement (18). The number of nodes required to resolve the solution to a given accuracy depends on the nature of the solution --- more nodes are needed to interpolate rapidly varying functions.

If the solution is rapidly varying in a small portion of the domain it would be wasteful to use the same (fine) nodal spacing throughout the domain. A non-\/uniform spacing, see below,  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fe_adaptive_interpolant}
\doxyfigcaption{Adaptive 1D finite element mesh\+: Non-\/uniform spacing of nodes to achieve a high resolution only where it is required. }
\end{DoxyImage}
 improves the accuracy of the solution without greatly increasing the total number of unknowns. Non-\/uniform spacing of the nodes is easy to implement and does not require any significant changes in Algorithm 2 -- we simply choose appropriate values for the nodal positions $ X_j $; an approach known as \char`\"{}h-\/refinement\char`\"{} because it alters the distance, $ h $, between nodes.

\begin{center} \tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu}spread 0pt [c]{*{1}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
\begin{center} {\bfseries{ An aside\+: adaptive mesh refinement }}\end{center}   A non-\/uniform distribution of nodes requires a priori knowledge of the regions in which we expect the solution to undergo rapid variations. The alternative is to use adaptive mesh refinement\+: start with a relatively coarse, uniform mesh and compute the solution. If the solution on the coarse mesh displays rapid variations in certain parts of the domain (and is therefore likely to be poorly resolved), refine the mesh in these regions and re-\/compute. Such adaptive mesh refinement procedures can be automated and are implemented in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} for a large number of problems; see the section \mbox{\hyperlink{index_example_P2}{A 2D example}} for an example.    \\\cline{1-1}
\end{longtabu}
\end{center} 

The quality of the interpolation can also be improved by using higher-\/order interpolation, but maintaining
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the compact support for the global shape functions, so that $ \psi_j(x) $ is nonzero only in the vicinity of node $ j $, and
\item the interpolation condition \[ \psi_j(X_i) = \delta_{ij} \] so that the shape function $ \psi_j $ is equal to one at node $ j $ and zero at all others.
\end{DoxyItemize}For instance, we can use the (global) quadratic finite-\/element shape functions shown below\+:  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{1Dmesh_with_quadratic_shape_fcts}
\doxyfigcaption{(Global) quadratic finite-\/element basis functions in 1D. }
\end{DoxyImage}
 Note that we could also use shape functions with identical functional forms; instead, we have chosen two different forms for the shape functions so that the smooth sections of the different shape functions overlap within the elements. This is not necessary but facilitates the representation of the global shape functions in terms of their local counterparts within elements, see section \mbox{\hyperlink{index_local_coords}{Local coordinates}}.

The implementation of higher-\/order interpolation does not require any significant changes in Algorithm 2. We merely specify the functional form of the (global) quadratic finite-\/element shape functions sketched above. This approach is known as \char`\"{}p-\/refinement\char`\"{}, because it increases order of the {\bfseries{p}}olynomials that are used to represent the solution.

\hypertarget{index_implementation}{}\doxysection{An element-\/by-\/element implementation for 1\+D problems}\label{index_implementation}
From a mathematical point of view, the development of the finite element method for the 1D model problem P1 is now complete, but Algorithm 2 has a number of features that would make it awkward to implement in an actual computer program. Furthermore, having been derived directly from Galerkin\textquotesingle{}s method, the algorithm is based on globally-\/defined shape functions and does not exploit the potential subdivision of the domain into \char`\"{}elements\char`\"{}. We shall now derive a mathematically equivalent scheme that can be implemented more easily.\hypertarget{index_book_keeping}{}\doxysubsection{Improved book-\/keeping\+: distinguishing between equations and nodes.}\label{index_book_keeping}
Since only a subset of the global finite-\/element shape functions act as basis functions for the (homogeneous) functions $ \phi^{(test)}(x)$ and $ u_h(x)$, algorithm 2 resulted in a slightly awkward numbering scheme for the equations and the unknown (nodal) values. The equation numbers range from 2 to $N-1$, rather than from 1 to $N-2$ because we identified the unknowns by the node numbers. Although this is perfectly transparent in our simple 1D example, the book-\/keeping quickly becomes rather involved in more complicated problems. We therefore treat node and equation numbers separately. \mbox{[}{\bfseries{Note\+:}} We shall use the terms \char`\"{}equation number\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}number of the unknown\char`\"{} interchangeably; this is possible because we must always have the same number of equations and unknowns.\mbox{]} We can (re-\/)write the finite-\/element solution (19) in more compact form as \[ u^{(FE)}(x) =\sum_{j=1}^{N} U_j \ \psi_j(x). \] where the summation now includes {\itshape all} nodes in the finite element mesh. To make this representation consistent with the boundary conditions, the nodal values, $U_j$, of nodes on the boundary are set to the prescribed boundary values \[ U_j = g(X_j) \mbox{\ \ \ if $X_j\in \partial D$}.\] In the 1D problem P1, $U_1=g_0$ and $U_N=g_1$.

Furthermore, we associate each unknown nodal value, $ U_j $, with a distinct equation number, ${\cal E}(j)$, in the range from 1 to $N-2$. In the above example, the equation numbering scheme is given by \[ \mbox{ \begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline \\ \mbox{Node number $j$} & 1 & 2 & 3 & ... & $N-1$ & $N$ \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Equation number ${\cal E}(j)$} & n/a & 1 & 2 & ... & $N-2$ & n/a \\ \hline \\ \end{tabular} } \] where n/a indicates a node whose value is prescribed by the boundary conditions. To facilitate the implementation in a computer program, we indicate the fact that a nodal value is determined by boundary conditions (i.\+e. that it is \char`\"{}pinned\char`\"{}), by setting the equation number to a negative value (-\/1, say), so that the equation numbering scheme becomes \[ \mbox{ \begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline \\ \mbox{Node number $j$} & 1 & 2 & 3 & ... & $N-1$ & $N$ \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Equation number ${\cal E}(j)$} & -1 & 1 & 2 & ... & $N-2$ & -1\\ \hline \\ \end{tabular} } \] We now re-\/formulate algorithm 2 as follows (the revised parts of the algorithm are enclosed in boxes)\+:

The residual associated with node k is given by \[ r_{{\cal E}(k)} = \int_0^1 \left( \frac{\mbox{d} u^{(FE)}(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} + f(x) \ \psi_k(x) \right) dx. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (20) \] The global finite-\/element shape functions have finite support, so the integrand is non-\/zero only in the two elements $k-1$ and $k$, adjacent to node $k$. This allows us to write \[ r_{{\cal E}(k)} = \int_{\mbox{Element }k-1} \left( \frac{\mbox{d} u^{(FE)}(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ dx + f(x) \ \psi_k(x) \right) dx + \int_{\mbox{Element }k} \left( \frac{\mbox{d} u^{(FE)}(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_k(x)}{\mbox{d} x} \ dx + f(x) \ \psi_k(x) \right) dx. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (21) \] Typically (e.\+g. in the Newton method) we require {\itshape all} the residuals $ r_k \ (k=1,...,M) $ --- the entire residual vector. We could compute the entries in this vector by using the above equation to calculate each residual $ r_{{\cal E}(k)}$ individually for all (unpinned) nodes $k$. In the process, we would visit each element twice\+: once for each of the two residuals that are associated with its nodes. We can, instead, re-\/arrange this procedure to consist of a single loop over the elements, in which the appropriate contribution is added to the global residuals associated with each element\textquotesingle{}s nodes. In order to achieve this, we must introduce the concept of local and global node numbers, illustrated in this sketch\+:  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{1Dmesh_local_and_global_node_numbers}
\doxyfigcaption{Local and global node numbers in a 1D mesh. }
\end{DoxyImage}
 We label the nodes in each element $ e $ with local node numbers so that for two-\/node elements, the left (right) node has the local node number 1 (2). The relation between local and global node numbers can be represented in a simple lookup scheme \[ j_{global} = {\cal J}(j_{local},e), \] which determines the global node number $ j_{global}$ of local node $ j_{local}$ in element $ e $. The lookup scheme establishes how the nodes are connected by elements and is one of the main steps in the \char`\"{}mesh generation\char`\"{} process. For the 1D example above, the lookup scheme is given by \[ \mbox{ \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l} \hline \\ \mbox{Element $e$} & 1 & & 2 & & ... & $N_E$ & \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Local node number $j$} & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & ... & 1 & 2 \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Global node number ${\cal J}(j,e)$} & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 &...& $N-1$ & $N$ \\ \hline \\ \end{tabular} } \] where $N=N_E+1$.

If we discretise the domain with three-\/node (quadratic) elements, as in this sketch,  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{1Dmesh_quadr_elements_local_and_global_eqn_numbers}
\doxyfigcaption{Local and global node numbers in a 1D mesh with three-\/node elements. }
\end{DoxyImage}
 the lookup scheme becomes \[ \mbox{ \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l l l l} \hline \\ \mbox{Element $e$} & 1 & & & 2 & & & ... & $N_E$ & & \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Local node number $j$} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 3 & ... & 1 & 2 &3\\ \hline \\ \mbox{Global node number ${\cal J}(j,e)$} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & ...& N-2 & N-1 &N\\ \hline \\ \end{tabular} } \] where $N=2 N_E+1$. Provided such a lookup scheme has been constructed, the global residual vector and the global Jacobian matrix for $n$-\/node elements can be assembled with the following algorithm

Each element makes a contribution to only a small number of entries in the global residual vector and the Jacobian matrix; namely, those entries associated with the unknowns stored at the nodes in the element. In general, each element is associated with $ {\cal N}_{dof}(e)$ unknowns, say. Element $e$ contributes to $ {\cal N}_{dof}(e)$ entries in the {\itshape global} residual vector and $ {\cal N}^2_{dof}(e)$ entries in the {\itshape global} Jacobian matrix. In fact, the finite support of the shape functions leads to sparse {\itshape global} Jacobian matrices and it would be extremely wasteful to allocate storage for all its entries, and use Algorithm 4 to calculate those that are non-\/zero. Instead, we combine each element\textquotesingle{}s contributions into ~\newline
 an $ {\cal N}_{dof}(e) \times {\cal N}_{dof}(e) $ \char`\"{}element Jacobian matrix\char`\"{} $ J_{ij}^{(e)}, \ i,j=1,...,{\cal N}_{dof}(e) $ and \char`\"{}element residual vector\char`\"{} $ r_{i}^{(e)}, \ i=1,..., {\cal N}_{dof}(e) $. These (dense) matrices and vectors are then assembled into the global matrix and residuals vector.

The entries in the element\textquotesingle{}s Jacobian matrix and its residual vector are labelled by the \char`\"{}local equation numbers\char`\"{}, which range from 1 to $ {\cal N}_{dof}(e)$ and are illustrated in this sketch\+:

In order to add the elemental contributions to the correct {\itshape global} entries in the residual vector and Jacobian matrix, it is necessary to translate between the local and global equation numbers; and we introduce another lookup scheme $ \widehat{\cal E}(i_{local},e)$ that stores the global equation number corresponding to local equation $i_{local}$ in element $e$. The lookup scheme can be generated by the following algorithm

\item Assign the number of degrees of freedom in the element, $ {\cal N}_{dof}(e)=j_{dof} $
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}For the 1D problem P1 with two-\/node elements, the lookup scheme has the following form\+: \[ \mbox{ \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l l l l } \hline \\ \mbox{Element $e$} & 1 & 2 & & 3 & & ... & $N_E-1$ & & $N_E$ \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Number of degrees of freedom ${\cal N}_{dof}(e)$} & 1 & 2 & & 2 & & ... & 2 & & 1\\ \hline \\ \mbox{Local equation number $i_{local}$} & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & ... & 1 & 2 & 1\\ \hline \\ \mbox{Global equation number $\widehat{\cal E}(i_{local},e)$} & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & ... & $N-3$ & $N-2$ & $N-2$ \\ \hline \\ \end{tabular} } \]

Note that the order in which we loop over the local degrees of freedom within each element {\itshape must} be the same as the order used when constructing the local equation numbering scheme of Algorithm
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \mbox{[}{\bfseries{Exercise\+:}} What would happen if we reversed the order in which we loop over the element\textquotesingle{}s nodes in Algorithm 5 while retaining Algorithm 6 in its present form? Hint\+: Note that the local equation numbers are computed \char`\"{}on the fly\char`\"{} by the highlighted sections of the two algorithms.\mbox{]} In an actual implementation of the above procedure, Algorithms 5 and 6 are likely to be contained in separate functions. When the functions are first implemented (in the form described above), they will obviously be consistent with each other. However, there is a danger that in subsequent code revisions changes might only be introduced in one of the two functions. To avoid the potential for such disasters, it is preferable to create an explicit storage scheme for the local equation numbers that is constructed during the execution of Algorithm 5 and used in Algorithm 6. For this purpose, we introduce yet another lookup table, $ {\cal L}(j_{local},e)$, which stores the local equation number associated with the nodal value stored at local node $ j_{local}$ in element $e$. Again we set the equation number to -\/1 if the nodal value is pinned. The revised form of Algorithm 5 is then given by (as before, only the sections that are highlighted have been changed)\+:

\hypertarget{index_local_coords}{}\doxysubsubsection{Local coordinates}\label{index_local_coords}
Algorithm 9 computes the residual vector and the Jacobian matrix using an element-\/by-\/element assembly process. The basis functions are still based on a global definition (17) that involves unnecessary references to quantities external to the element. For example, in element $ j $ the tests for $ x < X_j$ and $ x > X_{j+1}$ in (17) are unnecessary because these coordinate ranges are always outside the element. We shall now develop an alternative, local representation of the shape functions that involves only quantities that are intrinsic to each element. ~\newline
 For this purpose, we introduce a local coordinate $s \in [-1,1] $ that parametrises the position $ x(s) $ within an element so that (for two-\/node elements) the local coordinates $s=\pm 1$ correspond to local nodes 1 and 2, respectively. The local linear shape functions \[ \psi_1(s) = \frac{1}{2}(1-s) \mbox{\ \ \ and \ \ \ } \psi_2(s) = \frac{1}{2}(1+s)\] are the natural generalisations of the global shape functions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $ \psi_j(s) $ is equal to 1 at local node j and zero at the element\textquotesingle{}s other node,
\item $ \psi_j(s) $ varies linearly between the nodes.
\end{DoxyItemize}These local shape functions are easily generalised to elements with a larger number of nodes. For instance, the local shape functions for a three-\/node element whose nodes are distributed uniformly along the element, are given by \[ \psi_1(s) = \frac{1}{2} s (s-1), \ \ \ \psi_2(s) = (s+1)(1-s) \mbox{\ \ \ and \ \ \ } \psi_3(s) = \frac{1}{2} s (s+1). \] We represent the solution within element $ e $ as \[ u^{(FE)}(s) = \sum_{j=1}^n U_{{\cal J}(j,e)} \ \psi_j(s), \] where $n$ is the number of nodes in the element. $ u $ is now represented exclusively in terms of quantities that are intrinsic to the element\+: the element\textquotesingle{}s nodal values and the local coordinate. The evaluation of the integrals in algorithm 2 requires the evaluation of $ {\mbox{d} u}/{\mbox{d} x}$, rather than $ {\mbox{d} u}/{\mbox{d} s}$, and $f(x)$ rather than $f(s).$ In order to evaluate these terms, we must specify the mapping $ x(s) $ between the local and global coordinates. The mapping $ x(s) $ should be one-\/to-\/one and it must interpolate the nodal positions so that in a two-\/node element $e$ \[ x(s=-1) = X_{{\cal J}(1,e)} \mbox{\ \ \ and \ \ \ } x(s=1) = X_{{\cal J}(2,e)}.\] There are many mappings that satisfy these conditions but, within the finite-\/element context, the simplest choice is to use the local shape functions themselves by writing \[ x(s) = \sum_{j=1}^n X_{{\cal J}(j,e)} \ \psi_j(s). \] This is known as an \char`\"{}isoparametric mapping\char`\"{} because the same (\char`\"{}iso\char`\"{}) functions are used to interpolate the unknown function {\itshape and} the global coordinates. Derivatives with respect to the global coordinates can now be evaluated via the chain rule \[ \frac{\mbox{d} u}{\mbox{d} x} = \frac{\mbox{d} u}{\mbox{d} s} \left(\frac{\mbox{d} x}{\mbox{d} s}\right)^{-1}. \] In element $ e $, \[ \frac{\mbox{d} u}{\mbox{d} x} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^n U_{{\cal J}(j,e)} \ \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(s)}{\mbox{d} s} \right) \left(\sum_{j=1}^n X_{{\cal J}(j,e)} \ \frac{\mbox{d} \psi_j(s)}{\mbox{d} s} \right)^{-1}. \] Finally, integration over the element can be performed in local coordinates via \[ \int_e (...) \ dx = \int_{-1}^1 (...)\ \widehat{\cal J} \ ds, \] where \[ \widehat{\cal J} = \frac{\mbox{d} x}{\mbox{d} s} \] is the Jacobian of the mapping between $x$ and $ s. $

Typically the integrands are too complicated to be evaluated analytically and we use Gauss quadrature rules to evaluate them numerically. Gauss rules (or any other quadrature rules) are defined by
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the number of integration points $N_{int} $,
\item the position of the integration points in the element $S_{i}, \ i=1,...,N_{int} $,
\item the weights $W_{i}, \ i=1,...,N_{int} $,
\end{DoxyItemize}

and approximate the integral over the range $ s\in [-1,1]$ by the sum \[ \int_{-1}^1 {\cal F}(s)\ ds \approx \sum_{i=1}^{N_{int}} W_i \ {\cal F}(S_i). \]

As an example, the integration points and weights for a three-\/point Gauss rule are given by \[ \mbox{ \begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \\ \mbox{Integration point $i$} & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Location $S_i$} & $-\sqrt{3/5}$ & $ 0$ & $\sqrt{3/5}$ \\ \hline \\ \mbox{Weight $W_i$} & 5/9 & 8/9 & 5/9 \\ \hline \\ \end{tabular} } \]

\hypertarget{index_higher_dims}{}\doxysection{Extension to higher-\/dimensional problems}\label{index_higher_dims}
Thus far, we have only discussed the implementation of the finite element method for a 1D scalar problem. For such (relatively trivial) problems, the sophisticated \char`\"{}machinery\char`\"{} of Algorithm 10 might appear to be overly complicated. The advantage of the algorithm is that it can easily be generalised to more complicated problems. We will illustrate this by extending the algorithm to higher-\/dimensional problems and consider the solution of the 2D Poisson problem P2

\[ {\cal R}(x_i; u(x_i)) = \frac{\partial^2 u(x_i)}{\partial x_i^2} - f(x_i) =0 \mbox{ \ \ \ subject to \ \ \ } u|_{\partial D} = g, \] in the non-\/trivial (fish-\/shaped) domain shown in this sketch\+:  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fish_domain}
\doxyfigcaption{Fish-\/shaped domain }
\end{DoxyImage}
 A careful inspection of Algorithm 10 shows that only very few steps need to be modified to implement this extension. Specifically, we need to
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item modify the mesh generation process so that it
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item decomposes the domain into 2D elements
\item assigns two coordinates for each nodal point.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item define suitable (local) shape functions for the elements
\item implement the computation of the elements\textquotesingle{} residuals and Jacobian matrices which correspond to the (integrated-\/by-\/parts) weak form of problem P2, \[ r_k = \int_D \sum_{l=1}^2 \frac{\partial u(x_i)}{\partial x_l} \ \frac{\partial \psi_k(x_i)}{\partial x_l} \ dx_1 dx_2 + \int_D f(x_i) \ \psi_k(x_i) \ dx_1 dx_2 =0. \]
\end{DoxyItemize}

There are many ways to decompose the 2D domain into finite elements. The figure below shows a discretisation using four-\/node quadrilaterals\+: a generalisation of the two-\/node 1D elements used in problem P1\+:  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fish_domain_with_mesh}
\doxyfigcaption{Fish-\/shaped domain discretised with four-\/node quadrilateral }
\end{DoxyImage}
 Each node in the mesh now has two coordinates and we denote the $i$-\/th coordinate of nodal point $j$ by $ X_{ij}$ where $ i=1,2 $. We parametrise the 2D elements by two local coordinates, $ s_i \in [-1,1] \ (i=1,2)$, where the local nodes 1,2,3 and 4 are located at $(s_1,s_2)=(-1,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1)$ and $(1,1)$, respectively. We define the local shape functions as tensor products of the corresponding 1D linear shape functions, \[ \psi_1(s_1,s_2) = \frac{1}{4}(1-s_1)(1-s_2) \] \[ \psi_2(s_1,s_2) = \frac{1}{4}(1+s_1)(1-s_2) \] \[ \psi_3(s_1,s_2) = \frac{1}{4}(1-s_1)(1+s_2) \] \[ \psi_4(s_1,s_2) = \frac{1}{4}(1+s_1)(1+s_2), \] and note that shape function $ \psi_j(s_1,s_2)$ is equal to 1 at local node $j$ and it vanishes at the other local nodes, as required. The sketch below illustrates the corresponding global shape function associated with a node in the interior of the domain\+:  
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{fish_domain_with_shape_fct}
\doxyfigcaption{Discretised fish-\/shaped domain with a single (global) shape }
\end{DoxyImage}
 The solution $u$ and the coordinates $x_i$ in an isoparametric element $e$ can be written as \[ u = \sum_{j=1}^n U_{{\cal J}(j,e)} \ \psi_j(s_1,s_2) \] and \[ x_i = \sum_{j=1}^n X_{i{\cal J}(j,e)} \ \psi_j(s_1,s_2). \]

In 1D, the Jacobian of the mapping between $x$ and $s$ is given by $ \widehat{\cal J} = dx/ds$; in 2D the derivatives transform according to the linear system \[ \left( \begin{array}{c} \frac{\partial }{\partial s_1} \\ \frac{\partial }{\partial s_2} \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial x_1 }{\partial s_1} & \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial s_1} \\ \frac{\partial x_1 }{\partial s_2} & \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial s_2} \end{array} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c} \frac{\partial }{\partial x_1} \\ \frac{\partial }{\partial x_2} \end{array} \right), \] and \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} = \widehat{\cal J}_{ij}^{-1} \frac{\partial u}{\partial s_j} \] where $ \widehat{\cal J}_{ij}^{-1} $ is the inverse of the Jacobian of the mapping (not to be confused with the Jacobian matrix in the Newton method!), \[ \widehat{\cal J}_{ij} = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial s_j} = \sum_{k=1}^n X_{i{\cal J}(k,e)} \frac{\partial \psi_k(s_1,s_2)}{\partial s_j}. \] If \[ \widehat{\cal J} = \det \widehat{\cal J}_{ij} \] then the integrals over the elements are \[ \int \int_e (...) \ dx_1 dx_2 = \int_{-1}^{1} \int_{-1}^{1} (...) \ \widehat{\cal J} \ ds_1 ds_2. \]

The integrals over the elements can be evaluated by 2D Gauss rules \[ \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-1}^1 {\cal F}(s_1,s_2) \ ds_1 ds_2 \approx \sum_{i=1}^{N_{int}} {\cal F}(S_{i1},S_{i2}) \ W_{i}, \] where, for quadrilateral elements the integration points $S_{i1},S_{i2} \ (i=1,...,N_{int})$ and weights $ W_{i} \ (i=1,...,N_{int})$ are given by tensor products of the corresponding quantities in the 1D Gauss rules.

The solution was computed with {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}, using a \href{../../poisson/fish_poisson/html/index.html}{\texttt{ driver code}} discussed elsewhere. Initially, the solution is computed on a very coarse mesh which contains only four nine-\/node elements. Then the mesh is adaptively refined, guided by an automatic error estimator, and the problem is re-\/solved. This procedure is repeated several times. Note how the adaptation refines the mesh predominantly near the inward corners where the solution has an unbounded gradient and is therefore (always) under-\/resolved.

\hypertarget{index_towards_oo}{}\doxysection{An object-\/oriented implementation}\label{index_towards_oo}
The steps described in Algorithm 10 can easily be implemented in a procedural language such as Fortran or C. The algorithm already contains a number of well-\/defined phases, which lend themselves to implementation as subroutines/functions. The various (global) parameters (the number of nodes and elements, etc) and lookup schemes (the relation between local and global equation numbers, the number of unknowns per element, etc.) generated during the setup phase would usually be passed to the subroutines (or functions) via common blocks (or \href{http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad}{\texttt{ (bad!) global data}}).

We shall now discuss {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} object-\/oriented implementation of the finite-\/element method. We begin by examining the \char`\"{}objects\char`\"{} that occur naturally in algorithm 10 and aim to re-\/distribute all global data so that it becomes member data of an appropriate object. Three \char`\"{}objects\char`\"{} already feature prominently in many parts of our algorithms\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the Nodes,
\item the Elements,
\item the Mesh.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In the procedural version of the algorithm, data associated with Nodes is stored in global arrays. For instance, $ X_{ij}$ stores the $i$-\/th coordinate of global node $ j $; similarly, $ U_{j} $ stores the nodal value at global node $j$; etc. Nodal positions and values are accessed either directly via their global node number (which identifies Nodes within the Mesh) or indirectly via their local node number within an Element. The latter requires the global lookup scheme $ J(j_{local},e)$ which determines the global node number of local Node $j_{local}$ in Element $e$.

In {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} object-\/oriented implementation, all nodal data is stored as member data of a Node object. Each Node stores
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a (vector of) coordinates, and
\item a nodal value
\end{DoxyItemize}as private member data. Access to these data is provided by member functions, e.\+g. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Node node;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{double} x\_coord=node.x(0);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{double} y\_coord=node.x(1);}

\end{DoxyCode}


\mbox{[}Note the C++ convention of starting indices at 0, rather than 1!\mbox{]}

The Node object does {\bfseries{not}} store a node number! This is because node numbers are only used to identify Nodes in specific contexts. For instance, as discussed above, the global node number identifies Nodes within the context of the global Mesh. Instead, we provide the Mesh object with a member function {\ttfamily Mesh\+::node\+\_\+pt(...)} which provides pointer-\/based access to its constituent Nodes\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{unsigned} j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{Mesh mesh;}
\DoxyCodeLine{Node* node\_pt=mesh.node\_pt(j);}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Thus, we obtain the $x$-\/coordinate of global node $j$ via 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{unsigned} j;}
\DoxyCodeLine{Mesh mesh;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{double} x=mesh.node\_pt(j)-\/>x(0);}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Similarly, rather than determining the coordinates of local node $j_{local}$ in element $e$ via the global lookup scheme \[ x_i = X_{iJ(j_{local},e)}, \] we provide each {\ttfamily Finite\+Element} with a member function that provides pointer-\/based access to its constituent Nodes 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{unsigned} j\_local;}
\DoxyCodeLine{FiniteElement element;}
\DoxyCodeLine{Node* node\_pt=element.node\_pt(j\_local);}

\end{DoxyCode}


Similar procedures can be implemented for all other objects. We use the general design principle that all objects store only their \char`\"{}own\char`\"{} intrinsic data and we replace all global lookup schemes by pointer-\/based access functions. To guide the implementation, we observe the following inter-\/dependence between our three fundamental objects\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{The}} {\bfseries{Nodes\+:}} Nodes have positions and values. The nodal values are either \char`\"{}pinned\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}free\char`\"{}, in which case they represent unknowns in the problem. The \char`\"{}pinned status\char`\"{} of a Node is indicated by its global equation number, either a unique non-\/negative number, for unknowns, or -\/1, for values that are \char`\"{}pinned\char`\"{}. Note that this convention makes \char`\"{}-\/1\char`\"{} a \char`\"{}magic number\char`\"{} -- bad practice! In {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}, we set the equation number of pinned Nodes to {\ttfamily Node\+::\+Is\+\_\+pinned} -- a static data member of the Node class that is, in fact, set to -\/1.
\item {\bfseries{The}} {\bfseries{Elements\+:}} Elements contain Nodes and, within an Element, Nodes are identified by their local node numbers. Elements define their (local) shape functions and compute the elemental residual vector and Jacobian matrix, using data that is intrinsic to the Element. The entries in the Element\textquotesingle{}s residual vector and its Jacobian matrix are labelled by local equation numbers, and each element stores a lookup scheme for the correspondence between local and global equation numbers.
\item {\bfseries{The}} {\bfseries{Mesh\+:}} The Mesh consists of Elements and Nodes. The mesh generation process defines the nodal positions and establishes the connectivity between the Nodes. Meshes typically have a number of boundaries and the Mesh defines which Nodes are located on which boundary. Nodes are identified by a global node number within the Mesh.
\end{DoxyItemize}

An important difference between the three fundamental objects is the degree to which their member functions can be implemented in complete generality. For instance, the Node object is completely generic -- there is only one type of Node, allowing the Node class to be fully implemented (as a \char`\"{}concrete class\char`\"{}, in C++ terminology) in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}. Conversely, although all Meshes have a certain amount of common functionality (e.\+g. they all provide pointer-\/based access to their constituent nodes), the implementation of other functions are Mesh-\/specific. For instance, the Mesh generation process itself (typically performed in the Mesh constructor) depends on the domain geometry, the topology of its elements etc. Such functions must be implemented differently in different Meshes. {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} therefore provides an abstract base class {\ttfamily Mesh}, which defines and implements all functions that are common to all Meshes. The class also defines a number of virtual functions to establish standard interfaces for functions that can only be implemented in a concrete (derived) class, such as {\ttfamily Fish\+Mesh}. The same principle applies to Elements which we endow with a three-\/level inheritance structure\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The abstract base class {\ttfamily Generalised\+Element} defines the common functionality that {\itshape all} Elements must have. All Elements must have member functions that compute the elemental Jacobian matrix and the elemental residual vector. The distinction between {\ttfamily Generalised\+Elements} and {\ttfamily Finite\+Elements} is useful because many elements in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} are not finite elements, and, for instance, do not have nodes.
\item The abstract base class {\ttfamily Finite\+Element} is derived from {\ttfamily Generalised\+Element} and defines the common functionality that is shared by all finite elements. The {\ttfamily Finite\+Element} class implements all functions that are generic for finite elements and specifies the interfaces for any remaining functions that cannot be implemented in complete generality. For instance, all finite elements have shape functions but their implementation depends on the geometry of the element.
\item Finally, we have concrete Elements that are derived from {\ttfamily Finite\+Element} and implement any virtual functions defined at lower levels; these Elements provide a specific discretisation of a specific PDE. The {\ttfamily QPoisson\+Element$<$3,2$>$} implements, inter alia, the computation of the element residual and the element Jacobian matrix for the 2D Poisson equation, in a nine-\/node quadrilateral element. \mbox{[}{\bfseries{Note\+:}} In many cases, it is useful to sub-\/divide this level further by introducing an intermediate class that implements only the Element geometry; motivated by the observation that a specific (geometric) Element type (e.\+g. a 2D quadrilateral element) can form the basis for many different concrete Elements, e.\+g. Elements that solve the Poisson, Advection-\/\+Diffusion or Navier-\/\+Stokes equations. Examples of \char`\"{}geometric Elements\char`\"{} in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} include the {\ttfamily QElements}, a family of 1D line/2D quad/3D brick elements with linear (or \{bi/tri\}linear), quadratic (or \{bi/tri\}quadratic),... shape functions.\mbox{]}

Algorithm 10 can easily be expressed in an object-\/oriented form because most steps involve operations that act exclusively on the objects\textquotesingle{} member data. Such operations are implemented as member functions of the appropriate objects.

The steps in Algorithm 10 that do not fall into this category (the application of boundary conditions, setting of initial conditions and boundary values, etc) are usually problem-\/dependent and cannot be implemented in generality. However, certain steps (e.\+g. the solution of the nonlinear algebraic equations by Newton\textquotesingle{}s method) are identical for all problems and should be implemented in a general form. For this purpose, we introduce a fourth fundamental object, {\bfseries{The}} {\bfseries{Problem}}, an abstract base class that provides member functions for generic procedures such as
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item setting up the equation numbering scheme
\item solving the equations by Newton\textquotesingle{}s method
\end{DoxyItemize}

and stores
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a pointer to the Mesh object
\item a vector of pointers to the unknowns which must be updated during the solution of the nonlinear system by Newton\textquotesingle{}s method.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Concrete problems, such as the {\ttfamily Fish\+Poisson\+Problem} discussed above, should be derived from the abstract {\ttfamily Problem} class. Any problem-\/specific steps can be implemented in member functions of the derived class, often the constructor.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Here is an overview of overall data structure, as required by the Poisson problems described above. The complete data structure implemented in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} contains numerous extensions to permit the solution of time-\/dependent problems, problems with many nodal values, problems in deforming domains, adaptive mesh refinement and many other features. A complete description of \href{../../the_data_structure/html/index.html}{\texttt{ the data structure }} is given elsewhere.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} The subdivision into classes that define the element geometry and the specific equations to be solved is often useful but not compulsory. It is possible (and in some cases probably preferable) to provide the complete implementation for a specific element in a single class. Furthermore, not all elements in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} need to be {\ttfamily Finite\+Elements}. It is possible to formulate fully functional Generalised\+Elements. Such elements are often used to formulate discrete constraints or boundary conditions.
