The purpose of this document is to provide a means of navigating around the {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} documentation. The documentation is presented through a series of example codes which is fine if you know which type of problem you want to solve. In that case you can go directly to the appropriate section of the \href{../../example_code_list/html/index.html}{\texttt{ list of example codes. }} If you want to learn about general concept rather than a specific type of problem then it can be more difficult to find the appropriate documentation. In this index, both general concepts and specific types of problem are arranged alphabetically with hyperlinks to the appropriate documents. ~\newline
