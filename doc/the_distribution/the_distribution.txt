\section install Install the distribution

\subsection standard_install Installation with \c autogen.sh

Change into the \c oomph-lib directory and run the \c autogen.sh
build script:

\code
cd oomph-lib
./autogen.sh
\endcode

This build script will ask a few questions, e.g. to verify that the default
build directory (<code>build </code>, relative to the oomph-lib home
directory) is appropriate before starting the build.

By default, \c autogen.\c sh will build the library and the
demo codes with certain default settings (using the gcc compilers with full
optimisation, no debugging, no PARANOIA, and fully installed header files
rather than symbolic links). These are appropriate if you wish to install
the library once-and-for-all and do not anticipate any changes to their
sources. The section \ref custom_install provides more details on the
various options). `autogen.sh` will display the configure
options and ask for confirmation that they are appropriate. If you are
unsure if they are, simply hit return -- the default will be fine.

The following flags for `autogen.sh` may be of interest:

- `--jobs=n`: Run the build process using `n` cores. This can greatly speed
  up build times and is strongly recommended if you have a multicore
  machine.

- `--rebuild`: Rebuild the configuration files from scratch. This is 
  useful if you
  believe you may have somehow broken the build process, but should not be
  necessary normally.


Under the hood `autogen.sh` simply collects settings in a
question and answer manner then calls a non-interactive script 
`non_interactive_autogen.sh` (yes, really!) with the appropriate
flags. If you prefer you can simply call `non_interactive_autogen.sh` 
directly. 

The self-tests can be initiated outside of `autogen.sh` using
`make check -k` (to run on a single core) or `./bin/parallel_self_test.py`
(to run on all available cores). These commands will compile and run all
the demo codes and verify their output. This is an optional step and can be
very time consuming, especially if run on a small number of cores. 


\subsection custom_install Configuration options

The build scripts allow you to specify a file of configure options. 
For instance, you may wish to
specify another compiler, change the optimisation level, allow for
debugging or range checking, etc. Previously used sets of options are
stored in various files in the sub-directory `config/configure_options/`.
The default settings are in `default`; the currently used ones are in
`current`.

What options are there? You can get a complete list by typing

    ./configure --help

in `oomph-lib`'s top level directory. Here are some options that
we use frequently:


\subsubsection no_doc Suppressing the build of the documentation:
Building the online documentation locally is time consuming and
requires a significant amount of disk space. Since the documentation
is also available from the <A href="http://www.oomph-lib.org">oomph-lib
homepage</a> you may wish to suppress this step.
To achieve this, specify the configure option

    --enable-suppress-doc

\subsubsection no_pdf Suppressing the build of the pdf version of the documentation:
By default the tutorials are built as html files (which are best accessed by
starting from the local copy of the \c oomph-lib homepage, which is in
`doc/html/index.html`) and as pdf files
(which are accessible via a link at the bottom of the relevant html-based
tutorial). In the past we have sometimes had problems with 
\c doxygen (and hence the entire build process!) hanging while the 
pdf files are generated. To avoid this (by not even attempting
to create the pdf files) specify the configure option

    --enable-suppress-pdf-doc

(or better: update to a more recent version of \c doxygen -- for
instance version 1.8.6 works).

\subsubsection sym_links Replace library headers by symbolic links to the sources
During the build process \c oomph-lib's various libraries are installed in
the subdirectory \c build/lib (or in whatever other directory you may
have specified when asked to confirm their location) and the
associated header files are copied to \c build/include. This is a
sensible default for libraries that are only installed
once and then never again tinkered with. Here the situation is
slightly different: If you ever decide to add your own "user libraries" to \c
oomph-lib (and you are encouraged to do so!), their header files will 
also be copied to \c build/include. 
If during code development, any of your header files contain syntax errors,
the compiler will complain about the syntax errors in the copied file
in \c build/include rather than the one in your source directory. 
This will encourage you to edit the copied file rather than the
original -- clearly a recipe for disaster! To avoid it we provide 
the configure option 

     --enable-symbolic-links-for-headers

In this mode, the copies of the header files in \c build/include
are replaced by symbolic links to the actual sources in 
\c src or \c user_src. 
 
\subsubsection paranoia PARANOIA
\c oomph-lib provides an extensive range of optional run-time self-tests. The
self-tests issue diagnostic error messages if any inconsistencies are 
detected at run-time and then terminate the code execution (semi-)gracefully
by throwing an exception which (if not caught) aborts. This 
allows backtracking of the call sequence
in a debugger during code development. Obviously, the self-tests 
introduce a slight run-time overhead and are therefore only performed if the 
C++ code is compiled with a special compiler flag, \c PARANOID.
For gcc (and most other compilers we know) this is done by passing the flag
\c -DPARANOID to the C++ compiler. This is achieved by adding
\code
CXXFLAGS="-DPARANOID"
\endcode
to the configure options. As discussed, during code development, 
this is most useful if debugging is also enabled, so the combination
\code
CXXFLAGS="-g -DPARANOID"
\endcode
is common.


\subsubsection bounds Range checking
Most of the containers used in \c oomph-lib allow for optional
(and very costly!) range checking which is enabled by 
specifying the C++ compiler flag \c RANGE_CHECKING. You are advised
to recompile the code (yes, all of it!) if (and only if) you 
encounter some mysterious segmentation fault. Again, this is most
useful if used together with debugging,
\code
CXXFLAGS="-g -DRANGE_CHECKING"
\endcode
(Without the \c -g flag you will only find out that an illegal
index has been specified, not where this happened...)

\section nav Finding your way through the distribution

The \c oomph-lib distribution has several main sub-directories:

\subsection src The src directory

The \c src sub-directory contains the source code for the
various sub-libraries that make up \c oomph-lib.
The most important one is the \c generic library which is built from
the sources in the sub-directory \c src/generic. This library
defines the fundamental \c oomph-lib objects (nodes, elements, meshes,
timesteppers, linear and nonlinear solvers, mesh-adaptation routines,
etc.) 

The other libraries  (\c poisson, \c navier-stokes,...)
define elements for the solution of specific systems of PDEs. 

Finally, the \c src/meshes subdirectory contains several fully 
functional \c Meshes (and, where appropriate, the associated
\c Domains) that are used in the demo codes.
All \c Meshes in this directory are templated by the type of element they
contain. Since the element type can only be specified in the driver
codes, the meshes cannot be compiled into libraries --
the sources are always included as header-like files. Our 
<A HREF="../../example_code_list/html/index.html">list of
example codes</A> contains an 
<A HREF="../../poisson/two_d_poisson/html/index.html#precompile_mesh">
example</A> that explains this in more detail. 




\subsection ext_src The external_src directory

The \c  external_src directory contains "frozen" versions of
various external libraries (e.g.  
<A HREF="http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU">SuperLU</A>). Inclusion of these
libraries into the distribution facilitates the overall build process:
You only have to download and install a single distribution. This
is much easier than finding out (typically halfway through the install 
process), that library A depends on library B which invariably turns
out to depend on library C, etc.) Often the sources in the \c external_src
subdirectories are sub-sets of the full libraries. For instance,
we only include the double precision sources for 
<A HREF="http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU">SuperLU</A> as
neither the complex nor the single-precision versions are required 
within \c oomph-lib.

\subsection ext_dist The external_distributions directory

\c oomph-lib provides interfaces to various third-party libraries
which have their own build machinery. Some of these libraries are built by
default in the course of the oomph-lib installation, using tar 
files that are distributed with \c oomph-lib; others
will only be built if the user places the relevant tar files
into the approproriate location within the \c oomph-lib directory
structure.

\subsubsection cgal External distributions that are built by default

By default \c oomph-lib builds CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms 
Library, <a href="http://www.cgal.org">http://www.cgal.org</a>. This
library requires three other libraries which we also install:
- The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP), 
  <a href="https://gmplib.org">https://gmplib.org</a>.
- The GNU MPFR Library <a href="http://www.mpfr.org">https://gmplib.org</a>.
- The Boost library, <a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a>.
.
Note that the installation of these libraries is not quick. We
therefore provide the option to (i) suppress their installation (in which case
\c oomph-lib will employ a sub-optimal "locate_zeta" algorithm in its
multi-domain algorithms) or to (ii) link against already existing 
installations of the libraries; see \ref external_dist_cgal_etc for details.

\subsubsection trilinos_hypre_external External distributions that are not built by default

\c oomph-lib provides interfaces to various optional third-party libraries
whose sources we deemed to be too big to be included in the \c oomph-lib 
distribution. If you wish to use these we expect you to install them
yourself. To facilitate this task, we provide the option
to let the \c oomph-lib build machinery perform the installation
for you. If you place a copy of the tar file into the appropriate 
sub-directory in \c external_distributions, \c oomph-lib will build 
and install the library for you; see \ref external_dist for details.
(Note that \c oomph-lib is fully functional without these libraries --
if the libraries are not available the build process ignores any \c oomph-lib
code that depends on them.)


\subsection demo_drivers The demo_drivers directory

The \c demo_drivers directory contains a large number of demo codes.
They are arranged in sub-directories, based on the type of the
problem that is being solved. For instance, the \c demo_drivers/poisson 
subdirectory contains a number of demo problems involving
the Poisson equation.

 All sub-directories  in 
\c demo_drivers contain shell scripts that validate the output
from the demo codes by comparing the computed results against the
reference results stored in the \c validata sub-directories.
The comparison is performed with the \c python 
script \c bin/fpdiff.\c py which tolerates slight differences due
to the unavoidable variations in roundoff error on different 
platforms and/or at different optimisation levels. The validation
scripts can either be executed individually in each sub-directory
or for all sub-directories by issuing the command
\c make \c check.

 If the self-test is run at the top-level, a summary of the
self-tests is stored in \c self_test/analyse_self_tests/validation.\c log


\subsection doc The doc directory

The structure of the \c doc directory (approximately) mirrors that 
of \c demo_drivers
and contains the source code for the \c doxygen - based detailed
explanation of the demo codes. If \c configure locates a 
sufficiently up-to-date version of \c doxygen on your system,
the entire \c oomph-lib documentation will be built locally
and can be navigated from the homepage in
\c doc/html/index.\c html  -- a copy of the \c oomph-lib homepage.



\subsection user The user_src and user_drivers directories

The \c configure script and the associated \c Makefiles that build and 
install the \c oomph-lib libraries and demo codes are generated 
by  <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">autoconf</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">automake</A>. 
If these powerful tools are installed on your machine,
you can include your own libraries and driver codes into the
fully-automated \c oomph-lib build process. Store your code in 
suitably named sub-directories in \c user_src and \c user_drivers.
See \ref own for more details.

\section external External (third-party) libraries

\c oomph-lib provides interfaces to a number of third-party libraries.
Those libraries that are essential for \c oomph-lib are distributed 
with the library to ensure that the user does not have to install 
these separately. We also provide interfaces to a number of 
third-party libraries that are not distributed with \c oomph-lib,
typically because they are too big and/or take (too?) long to build. 
\c oomph-lib will only build the interfaces to these libraries if 
they are available and their location is specified during the
configuration stage (or if the appropriate tar file 
is dropped into the required directory in which case \c oomph-lib's
build process will build and install the library for you). In the
latter case, the compiler flags used to build \c oomph-lib will
be passed directly to the third-party libraries, so you may wish to compile
the libraries separately if you wish to specify different compiler
flags, e.g. no debugging information.


\subsection external_src External (third-party) libraries that are distributed with oomph-lib

\c oomph-lib provides local copies of the following third-party libraries:
- <A HREF="http://netlib.org/blas">BLAS</A>
- <A HREF="http://netlib.org/lapack">LAPACK</A>
- <A HREF="http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU">SuperLU</A>
- <A HREF="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/">METIS</A>
.
By default \c oomph-lib automatically builds and links against these.

\subsubsection blas Specifying an existing, local copy of the blas library

If a local, possibly optimised version of the 
<A HREF="http://netlib.org/blas">blas library</A>
already exists on your machine you can force \c oomph-lib to link
against it and avoid the compilation of \c oomph-lib's own copy. 

If  your local copy of the <A HREF="http://netlib.org/blas">blas library</A>
is located at 
\code
/home/mheil/local/lib/blas/blas.a
\endcode
say, you can link against it by specifying the configure option
\code
--with-blas=/home/mheil/local/lib/blas/blas.a
\endcode

\subsubsection lapack Specifying an existing, local copy of the lapack library
If a local, possibly optimised version of the 
<A HREF="http://netlib.org/lapack">lapack library</A>
already exists on your machine you can force \c oomph-lib to 
link against it and avoid the compilation of \c oomph-lib's
 own copy. 

For instance, if your local copy of the 
<A HREF="http://netlib.org/lapack">lapack library</A> is located at 
\code
/home/mheil/local/lib/lapack/lapack.a
\endcode
you can link against it by specifying the configure option
\code
--with-lapack=/home/mheil/local/lib/lapack/lapack.a
\endcode


\subsection external_dist_cgal_etc External (third-party) libraries whose tar files are distributed with oomph-lib

By default \c oomph-lib builds CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms 
Library, <a href="http://www.cgal.org">http://www.cgal.org</a>. This
library requires three other libraries which we also install:
- The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP), 
  <a href="https://gmplib.org">https://gmplib.org</a>.
- The GNU MPFR Library <a href="http://www.mpfr.org">https://gmplib.org</a>.
- The Boost library, <a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a>.
.
These four libraries are built from tar files that we downloaded
from the relevant webpages and then included into the \c oomph-lib
distribution. We adopted this procedure to ensure that the versions 
of the libraries are consistent with each other.

\subsubsection cgal_default_install Default CGAL installation.
 
By default the four libraries are installed within \c oomph-lib's
\c external_distributions directory, and the paths to the relevant
\c lib and \c include directories are propagated to \c oomph-lib's
\c Makefile s. The installations are deleted by "make clean" or 
"make distclean", i.e. they are treated like any other \c oomph-lib
code.

\subsubsection cgal_permanent_install Installing CGAL in a permanent location

Given that the installation of the libraries takes a fair amount of
time, we also provide the option to install them in a permanent location
outside the \c oomph-lib directory structure. This is done by
specifying the configure flag:
\code
--with-cgal-permanent-installation-dir=ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PERMAMENT_INSTALL_DIRECTORY
\endcode
where \c ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PERMAMENT_INSTALL_DIRECTORY specifies what
it says. So, for instance, specifying 
\code
--with-cgal-permanent-installation-dir=/home/mheil/junk_default_installation
\endcode
installs the libraries in \c /home/mheil/junk_default_installation.
In subsequent rebuilds of \c oomph-lib it is then possible to 
specify the location of these libraries using configure options.
Following an \c oomph-lib installation with 
\c --with-cgal-permanent-installation-dir these configure options 
are displayed at the end of the \c oomph-lib build procedure. (They are
also contained in the file  
\c external_distributions/cgal_configure_flags.txt.)
For instance, if the libraries have been installed in 
\c /home/mheil/junk_default_installation the relevant, the configure
options are:
\code
--with-boost=/home/mheil/junk_default_installation/boost_default_installation
--with-gmp=/home/mheil/junk_default_installation/gmp_default_installation
--with-mpfr=/home/mheil/junk_default_installation/mpfr_default_installation
--with-cgal=/home/mheil/junk_default_installation/cgal_default_installation
\endcode

hierher auto?

\subsubsection cgal_no_install Suppressing the CGAL installation
Finally, it is possible to suppress the installation of CGAL (and the
related libraries) using the configure option
\code
--enable-suppress-cgal-build
\endcode
In this case \c oomph-lib will employ a sub-optimal "locate_zeta" 
algorithm in its multi-domain algorithms.

\subsection external_dist External (third-party) libraries that are not distributed with oomph-lib

\subsubsection hypre Hypre

\c oomph-lib provides wrappers to the powerful solvers and
preconditioners from the
<a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/linear_solvers/sls_hypre.html">
Scalable Linear Solvers Project</a>. The wrappers are only built
if \c Hypre is available on your machine. If your local  
copy of the \c Hypre library installed in 
\code
/home/mheil/local/hypre
\endcode
i.e. if this directory contains \c Hypre's lib and include
directories:
\code
biowulf:~ 10:44:22$ ll /home/mheil/local/hypre
total 8
drwxr-xr-x    2 mheil    users        4096 Nov  3  2007 include
drwxr-xr-x    2 mheil    users        4096 Nov  3  2007 lib
\endcode
you can get \c oomph-lib to link against it (and to compile
\c oomph-lib's wrappers to \c Hypre's solvers and preconditioners)
by specifying the configure option
\code
--with-hypre=/home/mheil/local/hypre
\endcode


\b Note: \c oomph-lib works with version 2.0.0 of the library. 
If this version of \c Hypre is not available on your machine
download the tar file from the our own website: 

<CENTER>
<a href="../../../../oomph-lib_external_distfiles/hypre-2.0.0.tar.gz">hypre-2.0.0.tar.gz</a>
</CENTER>

You can either build the library yourself
or get \c oomph-lib to build it for you. To do this simply place a copy of the
tar file into the directory
\code
external_distributions/hypre
\endcode
and (re-)run \c autogen.sh. The installation procedure will detect
the tar file, unpack it, and install the library in 
\code
external_distributions/hypre/hypre_default_installation
\endcode
Unless you explicitly specified a library location using
the \c --with-hypre flag, \c oomph-lib will then link against
this newly created version of the library. However, we strongly
recommend moving the newly created library 
to another place (outside the \c oomph-lib distribution) to 
preserve it for future use. Once this is done you simply specify the 
(new) location of the library with the \c --with-hypre flag, as 
discussed above. (Also make sure to delete the tar file
from \c external_distributions/hypre, otherwise the library
will be re-built.) Note that \c make \c clean will delete the
unpacked \c Hypre sources but not the tar file and the library itself.



\subsubsection trilinos Trilinos
\c oomph-lib provides wrappers to the powerful solvers and
preconditioners from the
<a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov/">
Trilinos Project</a>. The wrappers are only built
if \c Trilinos is available on your machine. If your local  
copy of the \c Trilinos library installed in 
\code
/home/mheil/local/trilinos
\endcode
i.e. if this directory contains \c Trilinos's lib and include
directories:
\code
biowulf:~ 10:44:31$ ll /home/mheil/local/trilinos
total 24
drwxr-xr-x    2 mheil    users        4096 Dec 20 15:34 bin
drwxr-xr-x    2 mheil    users       16384 Dec 20 15:35 include
drwxr-xr-x    2 mheil    users        4096 Dec 20 15:35 lib
\endcode
you can get \c oomph-lib to link against it (and to compile
\c oomph-lib's wrappers to \c Trilinos's solvers and preconditioners)
by specifying the configure option
\code
--with-trilinos=/home/mheil/local/trilinos
\endcode


\b Note: \c oomph-lib should work with major version numbers 9, 10 and 11
of the Trilinos library, and for revision numbers from 11 onwards you will
need to have \c cmake installed on your machine.
If these versions of \c Trilinos are not available on your machine you
can get the latest version from the <a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov/">
Trilinos web site </a> or download a copy of the relevant tar file
from our own website:


<CENTER>
<a href="../../../../oomph-lib_external_distfiles/trilinos-11.8.1-Source.tar.gz">trilinos-11.8.1-Source.tar.gz</a>
</CENTER>

You can either build the library yourself
or get \c oomph-lib to build it for you. To do this simply place a copy of the
tar file into the directory
\code
external_distributions/trilinos
\endcode
and (re-)run \c autogen.sh. The build process is somewhat different
for major version numbers 9 and 10, but oomph-lib will detect this
automatically, provided that the source file is called
trilinos-N.*.tar.gz, where N is the major version number. 
The installation procedure will then detect
the tar file, unpack it, and install the library in 
\code
external_distributions/trilinos/trilinos_default_installation
\endcode
Unless you explicitly specified a library location using
the \c --with-trilinos flag, \c oomph-lib will then link against
this newly created version of the library. However, we strongly
recommend moving the newly created library 
to another place (outside the \c oomph-lib distribution) to 
preserve it for future use. Once this is done you simply specify the 
(new) location of the library with the \c --with-trilinos flag, as 
discussed above. (Also make sure to delete the tar file from
\c external_distributions/trilinos, otherwise the library
will be re-built.) Note that \c make \c clean will delete the
unpacked \c Trilinos sources but not the tar file and the library itself.

\subsubsection mumps MUMPS and ScaLAPACK

\c oomph-lib also provides wrappers to the 
<a href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS/"> MUMPS
</a> multifrontal solver, if it is available on your system. 
\c MUMPS needs the linear algebra library
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/"> 
 ScaLAPACK </a> which must also be installed on your system.
The
configure options
\code
--with-mumps=/opt/mumps
--with-scalapack=/opt/scalapack
\endcode
will compile \c oomph-lib's wrappers and link against the \c MUMPS
solver provided that \c MUMPS and ScaLAPACK </a> are installed in the 
directories 
\code
/opt/mumps
/opt/scalapack
\endcode
i.e. these directories contain the \c lib and \c include directories that
result from successful installations of \c MUMPS and \c ScaLAPACK,
respectively.


If you do not have \c MUMPS available you can download the latest
version 
<a href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS/index.php?page=dwnld"> here. </a>
You can build and install the library yourself, or get \c oomph-lib to build it
during part of its own build process. Simply place a copy of the tar file
\c MUMPS_4.10.0.tar.gz in the directory
\code
external_distributions/mumps_and_scalapack
\endcode
You will also need to download the \c scalapack_installer.tgz from 
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/#_scalapack_installer_for_linux">
here, </a> and place a copy in the same directory
\code
external_distributions/mumps_and_scalapack
\endcode


You can also download both files from our own website:
<CENTER>
<a href="../../../../oomph-lib_external_distfiles/MUMPS_4.10.0.tar.gz">MUMPS_4.10.0.tar.gz</a>
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
<a href="../../../../oomph-lib_external_distfiles/scalapack_installer.tgz">scalapack_installer.tgz</a>
</CENTER>

Note that the configure option
\code
--with-mpi-include-directory=/usr/lib/openmpi/include
\endcode
<b> must </b> be specified in order to build \c MUMPS, where \c
/usr/lib/openmpi/include is the directory that contains the file \c mpi.h.
[You can use `locate mpi.h`, to, well, locate that directory.]

Once the files have been placed in the \c
external_distributions/mumps_and_scalapack directory, simply (re-)run
\c autogen.sh, which will detect and build the libraries and install
then in directory
\code
external_distributions/mumps_and_scalapack/mumps_and_scalapack_default_installation
\endcode

Note that the installation of `ScaLAPACK` requires an
active Internet connection because it automatically downloads
additional files.

Unless you explicitly specified a library location using
the \c --with-mumps and \c --with-scalapack flags, 
\c oomph-lib will then link against
the newly created versions of the libraries. However, we strongly
recommend moving the libraries outside the \c oomph-lib distribution to 
preserve them for future use. Once this is done you simply specify the 
(new) location of the library with the \c --with-mumps and \c
--with-scalapack flags, as 
discussed above. (Also make sure to delete the tar files from
\c external_distributions/mumps_and_scalapack, otherwise the libraries
will be built again.) Note that \c make \c clean will delete the
unpacked sources but not the tar files nor the installed libraries.

\section own How to write your own code and link it against oomph-lib's library/libraries

If you followed the instructions so far, you will be able to install
\c oomph-lib and run the demo codes that are provided in the
\c demo_drivers directory. Great! Now on to the next step: How do 
you write your own codes and link them against \c oomph-lib? 
There are two options, depending on
whether you have (or are willing to install) the gnu autotools
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">autoconf</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">automake</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">libtool</A>
on your machine. 

\subsection have_auto_tools Writing/linking your own driver codes under autotools control

\subsubsection add_driver Adding your own driver codes
Let's start with the straightforward case: You want to use \c
oomph-lib to solve one of your own problems. To do this within 
\c oomph-lib's autotools framework, simply create a new
directory in \c user_drivers and write your driver code. To facilitate
these steps, the \c user_drivers directory already contains a 
sample directory \c joe_cool for which all these steps have been
performed. If you don't object to the directory name (or if your
name is Joe Cool) you can simply work in that directory. 
If not, we suggest the following sequence of steps:
-# Go to the \c user_drivers directory and create a new 
   directory, e.g.
\code
cd user_drivers
mkdir josephine_cool
\endcode

-# Copy the \c Makefile.am and the driver code \c joes_poisson_code.cc
   from \c user_drivers/joe_cool to \c user_drivers/josephine_cool.

-# Return to \c oomph-lib's top-level directory and re-run `./autogen.sh`
   to generate the required Makefile etc. in your own directory.

-# You may now return to your own directory in \c user_drivers and
   make your own driver code:
\code
cd user_drivers/josephine_cool
make
\endcode
   This will create the required executable. 
   \n\n
-# Unfortunately, the driver code (copied from Joe Cool's directory!) is 
   unlikely to be the one you want but you can now rename it, edit it, 
   or add further driver codes to your directory. In general we
   suggest that you have a look at the 
   <A HREF="../../example_code_list/html/index.html">list of
   example codes</A> and try to identify a problem that is similar to the
   one you want to solve. The associated driver code will be a good starting
   point for your own. Note that whenever you add new driver codes or
   rename existing ones you will have to update the local 
   \c Makefile.\c am, though it is not necessary to re-run
   \c autogen.\c sh. The sample \c Makefile.\c am
   copied from Joe Cool's directory is well annotated and gives
   clear instructions how to adapt its contents:
   \n\n
\include "joe_cool_makefile.am"
   \n\n 
   Note the following points: \n\n
   - Lines that start with a "#" are comments.
     \n\n
   - The first (non-comment) line in the above file specifies the name(s) of 
     the executable(s) that will be created by make. These names must be
     the same as those in the \c  *_SOURCES and \c *_LDADD variables. 
     \n\n
   - The \c joes_poisson_code_SOURCES variable declares which (local)
     sources your executable depends on. In the current example there
     is only a single file, the driver code,
     \c joes_poisson_code. \c cc, itself. 
     \n\n
   - The \c joes_poisson_code_LDADD variable declares:
     - the location of the library directory (automake
       will convert the macro \c -L\@libdir\@ into the actual 
       directory -- you don't have to change this!).
     - the libraries (\c oomph-lib or otherwise) that you wish to link
       against. This is done with the usual \c -l flag that you
       will be familiar with from your compiler. Have a look at the
       comments regarding the order of the libraries!
     \n\n
   - The \c INCLUDES variable specifies where to find the include
     header files. This line is again completely generic -- automake
     will convert the macro \c -I\@includedir\@ into the actual 
     location. 
     \n\n
   - If you have multiple driver codes, add the name of all
     executables to the \c noinst_PROGRAMS variable, and specify
     the \c *_SOURCES and \c *_LDADD variables
     for each one. 
     \n\n
   - The \c INCLUDES variable should only be specified once.
   .
  
It makes sense to create a separate GitHub repository for your user
driver directory. This won't interfere with the forked/cloned
oomph-lib repository that you're working within. As far as the \c
oomph-lib repository is concerned your user driver directory is simply
one of possibly many directories that it's not tracking. Similarly, from
within your user driver directory, the files outside it are not
tracked by your repository, so the two can happily co-exist.

\subsubsection add_src Adding new libraries and linking against them from driver codes

The above instructions should be sufficient to get you started.
You can create multiple sub-directories for different projects 
and each sub-directory may, of course, contain multiple files, 
separated into header and source files. \c automake will ensure that 
only those files that have been
changed will be recompiled when you issue the \c make
command. However, at some point you may wish to package some of your sources 
into your own library and maybe even offer it for permanent inclusion into
\c oomph-lib. For this purpose the \c oomph-lib distribution provides the
sub-directory \c user_src which closely mirrors that of the 
\c src and \c external_src directories discussed earlier. During the
build process, each  sub-directory in  \c user_src is compiled
into its own library and installed in the standard location. 

 The steps required to include your own library into the \c oomph-lib
build process are very similar to those required to
add additional user drivers. As before, the \c user_src directory 
already contains a sample directory \c jack_cool, to facilitate
the procedure. We therefore suggest the following sequence of steps:
-# Go to the \c user_src directory and create a new 
   directory, e.g.
\code
cd user_src
mkdir jacqueline_cool
\endcode
   \n\n
-# Copy the \c Makefile.am and the codes \c hello_world.cc and 
   \c hello_world.h 
   from \c user_src/jack_cool to \c user_src/jacqueline_cool.
   \n\n
-# Return to the top-level \c oomph-lib directory and re-run
   `autogen.sh`.

-# You may now return to your own directory in \c user_src and
   make and install our own library
\code
cd user_src/jacqueline_cool
make
make install
\endcode
   This will create the library and install it in \c build/lib
   \n\n
   The \c Makefile.\c am for libraries is slightly more complicated
   (though reasonably well documented) so -- for now -- we'll
   just list it here and hope that the changes required 
   to include additional sources are obvious. If you really can't
   figure it out, send us an email and prompt us to complete
   this bit of the documentation....
   \n\n
\include "linked_make_file.am" 

Note that the directory  \c user_drivers/jack_cool contains
an example of a user driver code (\c jacks_own_code \c .cc) 
that uses a user library.



\subsection dont_have_auto_tools Writing/linking user code without autotools: How do I treat \c oomph-lib simply as a library?
Linking directly against \c oomph-lib's (sub-)libraries 
is slightly complicated by cross-compilation issues arising from
the fact that the \c oomph-lib distribution includes a few C and Fortran 
sources. When linking is done (by the C++ compiler) one usually has to 
explicitly specify a few compiler-specific Fortran libraries.
The beauty of the \c autotools approach described above is that these libraries
(and any other flags that need to be passed to the compiler/linker)
are determined and specified automatically. Doing this manually 
is no fun! Have a look at
Mike Gerdts's excellent document 
<A HREF="https://sites.google.com/site/mgerdts/whatgccreallydoes">
"How gcc really works"</A> for details.

 The good news is that \c oomph-lib's installation procedure automatically 
generates a sample \c Makefile that contains all the relevant
information. Once the installation is complete, the sample makefile is
located at
\code
demo_drivers/linking/makefile.sample
\endcode
Here is the version that was generated one of our machines:

\include makefile.sample.biowulf

The version that is generated during the build process
on your machine provides template for your own customised
Makefiles. When modifying the sample to different driver codes, 
you should not (have to) edit any of the "installation specific"
variables. Simply specify the \c oomph-lib (sub-)libraries that you wish to 
link against in the \c OOMPH_LIB-LIBS variable (in the example shown
above, we are linking against the \c generic and \c poisson libraries),
and specify the dependencies for your own driver code, following the
usual \c Makefile syntax. The executable may then be created by the usual
\code
make -f makefile.sample my_demo_code
\endcode

<a name="apple_linking">
<b>Note/Disclaimer:</b></a> The sample \c Makefile generated during \c oomph-lib's 
installation should work for most (if not all) linux machines, though it may
require slight tweaks for Darwin (the BSD-derived UNIX core of Apple's
OSX operating system). Problems are most 
likely to arise from the \c SHARED_LIBRARY_FLAGS variable. 
As mentioned in the comment in the sample \c Makefile, on such 
machines the fragment <code>-Wl,--rpath -Wl,</code> should be deleted from the 
\c SHARED_LIBRARY_FLAGS variable.
