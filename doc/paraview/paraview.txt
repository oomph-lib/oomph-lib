\mainpage Visualising oomph-lib's output files with Paraview

All of \c oomph-lib's existing elements implement the
\c GeneralisedElement::output(...) functions, allowing
the computed solution to be documented via a simple
call to the \c Mesh::output(...) function, e.g.

\code
// Open output file
ofstream output_file("output.dat")

// Call the mesh's output function which loops over the 
// element and calls theirs...
Problem::mesh_pt()->output(output_file);
\endcode

By default, the output is written in a format that is suitable
for displaying the data with <A HREF="http://www.tecplot.com">
tecplot,</A> a powerful and easy-to-use commercial plotting package
-- possibly a somewhat odd choice for a an open-source library. 

We also provide the capability to output data in 
a format that is suitable for display with 
<a href="http://www.paraview.org/New/index.html">paraview</a>,
an open-source 3D plotting package.
For elements for which the relevant output functions are
implemented (they are defined as broken virtual functions in the
\c FiniteElement base class) output files for all the elements
in a certain mesh (here the one pointed t by \c Bulk_mesh_pt) can 
be written as

\dontinclude rayleigh_instability.cc
\skipline Output solution to file in paraview format
\skipline some_file.open(
\until some_file.close();

where the unsigned integer \c npts  controls the number of plot points per
element (just as in the tecplot-based output functions). If \c npts
is set to 2, the solution is output at the elements' vertices. For 
larger values of \c npts the solution is sampled at greater number of (equally
spaced) plot points within the element -- this makes sense for 
higher-order elements, i.e. elements in which the finite-element solution is not
interpolated linearly between the vertex nodes. It is important to note that
when displaying such a solution in paraview's "Surface with Edges" mode, the 
"mesh" that is displayed does not represent the actual finite element mesh but is a
finer auxiliary mesh that is created merely to establish the connectivity
between the plot points.

Paraview makes it possible to animate sequences of plots from
time-dependent simulations. To correctly animate results from
temporally adaptive simulations (where the timestep varies)
paraview can operate on pvd files which provide a list of 
filenames and the associated time. These can be written automatically
from within \c oomph-lib, using the functions in the \c ParaviewHelper
namespace:

\dontinclude mesh.h
\skipline paraview_helper
\until }

Once the pvd file is opened, call \c
ParaviewHelper::write_pvd_header(...) to write the header information
required by paraview; then add the name of each output file 
and the value of the associated value of the continous time, using \c
ParaviewHelper::write_pvd_information(...). When the simulation is
complete write the footer
information using \c
ParaviewHelper::write_pvd_footer(...), then close to the pvd file.

Currently, the paraview output functions are only implemented for a
relatively small number of elements but it is straightforward
to implement them for others.

The <a href="../../FAQ/html/index.html">FAQ</a> contain
an entry that discusses how to display \c oomph-lib's output
with <A HREF="http://www.gnuplot.info">gnuplot</A> and 
<a href="../../FAQ/html/index.html#tecplot">
how to adjust \c oomph-lib's output functions to different 
formats.</a>
  


Angelo 
Simone has written a python script that converts \c oomph-lib's
output to the vtu format that can be read by 
<a href="http://www.paraview.org/New/index.html">paraview</a>. 
This has since been improved
and extended significantly with input from Alexandre Raczynski and 
Jeremy van Chu. The conversion script
can currently deal with output from meshes that are composed
of 2D triangles and quad and 3D brick and tet elements. 

The \c oomph-lib distribution contains three scripts:

- <a href="../../../bin/oomph-convert.py"><code>bin/oomph-convert.py
  </code>:</a> The python conversion script itself.
  \n\n
- <a href="../../../bin/oomph-convert"><code>bin/oomph-convert
  </code>:</a> A shell script wrapper that allows the processing of
  multiple files.
  \n\n
- <a href="../../../bin/makePvd"><code>bin/makePvd</code>:</a>
  A shell script the creates the \c * \c .pvd files required by
  paraview to produce animations.

If your output file is invalid or contains elements
that cannot currently be converted, you can use the \c -p option (followed by
2 or 3 to indicate the spatial dimension of the problem) to 
extract points only:

   \code
   biowulf: 11:16:13$ oomph-convert.py -p2 soln0.dat
   \endcode
   \n

The output is now a .vtp data file (Visualization Toolkit Polygonal)
which is also supported by Paraview. To display your .vtp data, use the
@I w 0.03\textwidth glyph_button " "
\c Glyph filter (displaying the points as crosses, say). Here 
is a representative plot in which 
<a href="../../poisson/fish_poisson/html/index.html"> the adaptive 
solution of a 2D Poisson equation in a fish-shaped domain</a>
is displayed with points. 


@I w \textwidth paraview00 " "


\subsection display Display your data

Here are a few screenshots from a paraview session to get you
started. When paraview starts up, you have to select
the arrays of values you want to load and click on 
@I w 0.07\textwidth apply_button " "
\c Apply:
 
@I w \textwidth paraview01 " "


Select the array of values you want to display in the active window
(V1, V2, V3...). You can only display one at a time. It is applied on
the data set selected in the pipeline:

@I w \textwidth paraview02 " "


Now choose the plot style of your data. \c Outline display a box containing
the data but not the data itself (it's not entirely clear to us
why you would want to do this, but...). \c Points and \c Wireframe 
best suited for 3D computations because they allow you to "see 
through" the data set. 
\c Surface and
\c Surface \c With \c Edges is best suited for 2D computations
because only the surface is displayed. Here is a view of the data 
in \c Wireframe mode:

@I w \textwidth paraview03 " "


You can move the figure with buttons
@I w 0.30\textwidth move_button " "
in the toolbar or simply with the
mouse: "Left click + Move" to rotate, "Middle click + Move" to move, zoom in
with scroll up or "Right click + Move up" and zoom out with scroll down
or "Right click + Move down".

@I w \textwidth paraview04 " "


You can also display the color legend by clicking on 
@I w 0.03\textwidth legend_button " "
, change the display colors (HSV,
RGB, Diverging...) by clicking on
@I w 0.03\textwidth color_button " "
, and rescale the color scale to data by clicking on
@I w 0.03\textwidth scale_button " "
. Modifying the color scale is easy: add
points by clicking on the colour bar to change the distribution of colours
or use a logarithmic scale.

@I w \textwidth paraview05 " "


You can split a window by clicking on 
@I w 0.07\textwidth split_button " "
. Clicking on the plot window will make
it active. You can switch on/off the display of a pipeline member by
clicking on the eye
@I w 0.02\textwidth eye_button " "

\subsection py_sample_mult_par An example session for data from a parallel computation
 	 
\c oomph-lib typically outputs results from parallel (distributed)
computations on a processor-by-processor basis, resulting in filenames 
of the form
\code
 	 soln_proc0_0.dat 	 	 \ 
 	 soln_proc1_0.dat 	 	 | 
 	 	 : 	 	 	 | Data for timestep 0 
 	 soln_proc[NPROC-1]_0.dat 	 / 
 	 	 
 
 	 soln_proc0_1.dat 	 	 \ 
 	 soln_proc1_1.dat 	 	 | 
 	 	 :                    	 | Data for timestep 1 
 	 soln_proc[NPROC-1]_1.dat, 	 /

                 :

\endcode
where NPROC is the number of processors. An animation of such data 
obviously requires the output from different processors (but for the 
the same timestep) to be combined. Provided, the filenames have 
the pattern 
\code
	 [stem]proc[processor_number]_[timestep_number].dat
\endcode
(note the "proc" and "_", both of which are required), the pvd file 
can be generated by first processing the files with \c oomph-convert,
\code
        oomph-convert -z [stem]proc* 
\endcode
followed by 
\code
         makePvd [NPROC] [stem] myplot.pvd 
\endcode
So, for the files listed above, to produce a pvd file that 
contains data from a computation with four processors the commands
\code
biowulf: 12:40:56$ oomph-convert soln_proc*
\endcode
followed by
\code
biowulf: 12:40:59$ makePvd 4 soln_ soln.pvd 
\endcode
would create the file soln.pvd from which paraview 
can create an animation of the solution.

\section filters Data analysis with filters

In order to analyse the data, we can apply filters. Some filters are
accessible directly via the navigation bar; a full list is available
in the \c Filters menu:

@I w \textwidth paraview06 " "

Here are few examples of filters available:

-# \c Calculator: Evaluates a user-defined expression e.g \f$
   \frac{1}{2} V1^2 \f$ and creates a new data array, called here
   "Energy", containing the result of this expression:
   \n
@I w \textwidth paraview07 " "
   \n
-# \c Contour: Extracts the points, curves or surfaces where a scalar
   field is equal to a user-defined value e.g \f$ V1 = -0.5 \f$:
   \n
@I w \textwidth paraview08 " "
   \n
-# \c Clip: Intersects the geometry with a half space. (Warning:
   with some versions of Paraview, zooming on the clipped surface can
   cause the X server to crash.)
   \n
@I w \textwidth paraview09 " "
@I w \textwidth paraview091 " "
   \n
-# \c Slice: Intersects the geometry with a plane. (Warning:
   with some versions of Paraview, zooming on the clipped surface can
   cause the X server to crash.)
   \n
@I w \textwidth paraview10 " "
@I w \textwidth paraview11 " "
   \n
-# \c Threshold: Extracts cells that lie within a specified range of
values

\subsubsection display Display multiple files


Click on the
@I w 0.03\textwidth open_button " "
\c Open button to load the files. You can set the properties for each
collection separately. Here is an example of data produced in a
parallel simulation on a fluid structure interaction problem: the pipe
is displayed in "Solid Color" and the fluid in "Wireframe"

@I w \textwidth how_to_02 " " 
 

\subsubsection warp Visualisation of a scalar field by warping -- "carpet plots"

If you want to visualise a scalar field, you can warp the
domain using the filter \c Filters->Alphabetical->Warp \c by \c
Scalar. This allows the results from a 2D simulation \f$ u(x,y) \f$ , to be
displayed as a "carpet plot" in the form \f$ z=f(x,y)\f$ 
as in this example which shows, yet again, the solution of a 2D
Poisson  equation on a fish shaped domain:

@I w \textwidth how_to_021 " "
@I w \textwidth how_to_022 " "


\subsubsection vecstream Create vectors and display streamlines

To create a vector, go to \c Filters->Alphabetical->Python \c Calculator and
enter the expression \c hstack([component1,component2,component3]) and 
@I w 0.07\textwidth apply_button " "
\c Apply the filter to create your 3D vector.


You can also use the simple \c Calculator: enter the expression \c
V1 * \c iHat + \c V2 * \c jHat + \c V3 * \c kHat and
@I w 0.07\textwidth apply_button " "
\c Apply the filter to create your 3D vector.

@I w \textwidth how_to_03 " "


To visualise these vectors, you have to use the 
@I w 0.03\textwidth glyph_button " "
\c Glyph filter. You can set the type (arrows, cones...), the size and the
number of points:

@I w \textwidth how_to_031 " "


After creating your data vector, you can also display streamlines by clicking on the button 
@I w 0.03\textwidth stream_button " "
\c Stream \c Tracer in the bar or in the menu \c Filters->Common->Stream \c
Tracer. Select the source type (point or line) and 
@I w 0.07\textwidth apply_button " "
\c Apply the filter. To modify the plot style, you can also use the 
@I w 0.03\textwidth glyph_button " "
\c Glyph filter. Vorticity and Normals can be displayed along these streamlines.

@I w \textwidth how_to_04 " "


\subsubsection reflec Mirroring data

You can mirror data using the "Reflect" filter in \c
Filters->Alphabetical->Reflect. This is particularly useful if your
computation has exploited spatial symmetries in the domain and has
therefore only be performed in a fraction of the domain.
Reflections make it possible to display the data for the full domain.
as shown in this figure:

@I w \textwidth how_to_041 " "


\subsubsection text Display text in the plot

To insert text in the plot, go to \c Sources->3D \c Text. To move the
text in the plot, go to \c Object \c Inspector->Display and
apply the transformation:

@I w \textwidth how_to_05 " "


\subsubsection save Save your work and record macros

You can save the whole geometry in \c File->Save \c Geometry in a
.pvd file. However, as all .pvd files, it requires other source files to
be in the same directory. To save your work and the whole data in one single .vtp file (Visualization Toolkit Polygonal Data file), you have to use \c
File->Save \c State.

These files can then be re-loaded from the \c File->Open menu.

To save the complete layout (the view, the geometry, the pipeline...),
you can save macros which can then also be applied to display a different
dataset. To do this, go to \c Tools->Python \c Shell. Recording is
initiated in the menu \c Trace. Start the animation by clicking on
\c Start \c Trace, then perform the actions on the data and on the
plot, and finally stop recording with \c Stop \c Trace and \c Save 
\c Trace. Afterwards, you will be able to run the recorded 
macro in the menu \c Directory \c View of the \c Python \c
Shell.

@I w \textwidth how_to_06 " "


\subsubsection output Output: Screenshots and videos

You can save screenshots  of the active window 
in .png, .gif, .jpg, .tif, .pdf and .ppm format in the menu \c
File->Save \c Screenshots.

Depending on the version of Paraview and the setup, Paraview 
can record \c .avi videos. If this is not possible with your
installation, go to \c File->Save \c Animation and save the 
animation in .jpg, .png or .tif format. 

@I w \textwidth how_to_07 " "


These image files can then be combined into a video using \c
mencoder, for example to combine all png files in the current
directory to an avi file use:
\n
\code
mencoder "mf://*.png" -mf fps=25 -o output.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4
\endcode
\n

In the above example the speed is set to 25 frames per second
(fps). See the mencoder man page for further details.
