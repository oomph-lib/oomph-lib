{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} beam elements are based on geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff-\/\+Love beam theory with incrementally linear constitutive equations (Young\textquotesingle{}s modulus $ E $ and Poisson\textquotesingle{}s ratio $ \nu $). The equations are implemented in non-\/dimensional form, obtained by non-\/dimensionalising all length on some lengthscale $ {\cal L} $, by scaling the stresses and the applied traction on the beam\textquotesingle{}s effective Young\textquotesingle{}s modulus $ E_{eff} = E/(1-\nu^2) $ and by non-\/dimensionalising time on some timescale $ {\cal T} $ so that the dimensional (identified by an asterisk) and non-\/dimensional variables are related by \[ L^* = {\cal L} \ L, \] \[ h^* = {\cal L} \ h, \] \[ t^* = {\cal T} \ t, \] \[ p_{ext}^* = E_{eff} \ p_{ext}, \] and \[ \sigma_0^* = E_{eff} \ \sigma_0. \] The beam\textquotesingle{}s undeformed shape is parametrised by a non-\/dimensional Lagrangian coordinate $ \xi = \xi^*/{\cal L} $ so that the non-\/dimensional position vector to a material particle on the beam\textquotesingle{}s centreline in the undeformed configuration is given by $ {\bf r}_w(\xi) $ . We denote the unit normal to the beam\textquotesingle{}s undeformed centreline by $ {\bf n} $. The applied traction $ {\bf f} = {\bf f}^*/E_{eff} $ (a force per unit deformed length of the beam) deforms the beam, causing its material particles to be displaced to their new positions $ {\bf R}_w(\xi) $; the unit normal to the beam\textquotesingle{}s deformed centreline is $ {\bf N} $.

The non-\/dimensional form of the principle of virtual displacements that governs the beams deformation is then given by \[ \int_0^{L} \left[ (\sigma_0 + \gamma) \ \delta \gamma + \frac{1}{12} h^2 \kappa \ \delta \kappa - \left(\frac{1}{h} \sqrt{\frac{A}{a}} \ {\bf f} - \Lambda^2 \frac{\partial^2 {\bf R}_w}{\partial t^2} \right) \cdot \delta {\bf R}_w \right] \ \sqrt{a} \ d\xi = 0, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1) \] where \[ a = \frac{\partial {\bf r}_w}{\partial \xi} \cdot \frac{\partial {\bf r}_w}{\partial \xi}, \] and \[ A = \frac{\partial {\bf R}_w}{\partial \xi} \cdot \frac{\partial {\bf R}_w}{\partial \xi}, \] represent the squares of the lengths of infinitesimal material line elements in the undeformed and the deformed configurations, respectively. \[ ds = \sqrt{a} \ d\xi \mbox{\ \ \ \ and \ \ \ } dS = \sqrt{A} \ d\xi. \] $ A $ and $ a $ may be interpreted as the \char`\"{}1x1 metric tensors\char`\"{} of the beam\textquotesingle{}s centreline, in the deformed and undeformed configurations, respectively. The ratio $ \sqrt{A/a} $ represents the \char`\"{}extension ratio\char`\"{} or the \char`\"{}stretch\char`\"{} of the beam\textquotesingle{}s centreline.

We represent the curvature of the beam\textquotesingle{}s centreline before and after the deformation by \[ b = {\bf n} \cdot \frac{\partial^2 {\bf r}_w}{d\xi^2} \] and \[ B = {\bf N} \cdot \frac{\partial^2 {\bf R}_w}{d\xi^2} \] respectively. The (\char`\"{}1x1\char`\"{}) strain and and bending \char`\"{}tensors\char`\"{} $ \gamma $ and $ \kappa $ are then given by \[ \gamma = \frac{1}{2}\left(A-a\right) \mbox{\ \ \ and \ \ \ } \kappa = - \left( B-b \right). \] Finally, \[ \Lambda = \frac{{\cal L}}{{\cal T}} \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{E_{eff}}} \] is the ratio of the natural timescale of the beam\textquotesingle{}s in-\/plane extensional oscillations, \[ {\cal T}_{natural} = {\cal L} \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{E_{eff}}}, \] to the timescale $ {\cal T}$ used in the non-\/dimensionalisation of the equations. $ \Lambda^2 $ may be interpreted as the non-\/dimensional wall density, therefore $ \Lambda=0 $ corresponds to the case without wall inertia.

{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily Hermite\+Beam\+Element} provides a discretisation of the variational principle (1) with one-\/dimensional, isoparametric, two-\/node Hermite solid mechanics elements. In these elements, the Eulerian positions of the nodes, accessible via {\ttfamily Node\+::x(...)}, are regarded as unknowns, and Hermite interpolation is used to interpolate the position between the nodes, so that the Eulerian position of material points within an element is given by \[ x_i(s) = \sum_{j=1}^2 \sum_{k=1}^2 X_{ijk} \ \psi_{jk}(s) \mbox{\ \ \ for $i=1,2$}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2) \] where $ s \in [-1,1] $ is the element\textquotesingle{}s 1D local coordinate. The functions $ \psi_{jk}(s) $ are the one-\/dimensional Hermite shape functions \[ \psi_{11}(s) = \frac{1}{4}\left(s^3 - 3s + 2\right), \] \[ \psi_{12}(s) = \frac{1}{4}\left(s^3 - s^2 - s +1 \right), \] \[ \psi_{21}(s) = \frac{1}{4}\left(2 + 3 s - s^3\right), \] \[ \psi_{22}(s) = \frac{1}{4}\left(s^3 + s^2 -s -1 \right). \] They have the property that
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $ \psi_{j1} = 1 $ at node $ j $ and $ \psi_{j1} = 0 $ at the other node. Furthermore, $ d\psi_{j1}/ds = 0 $ at both nodes.
\item $ d\psi_{j2}/ds = 1 $ at node $ j $ and $ d\psi_{j2}/ds = 0 $ at the other node. Furthermore, $ \psi_{j2} = 0 $ at both nodes.
\end{DoxyItemize}The mapping (2) therefore provide an independent interpolation for the position and its derivative with respect to the local coordinate $ s $. As a result we have two types of (generalised) nodal coordinates\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $ X_{ij1} $ represents the $ i $-\/th coordinate of the element\textquotesingle{}s local node $ j $.
\item $ X_{ij2} $ represents the derivative of $ i $-\/th coordinate with respect to the local coordinate $ s $, evaluated at the element\textquotesingle{}s local node $ j $.
\end{DoxyItemize}This representation ensures the $ C^1 $ continuity of the wall shape, required by the variational principle (1) which contains second derivatives of $ {\bf R}_w $. Physically, the inter-\/element continuity of the slope is enforced by the beam\textquotesingle{}s nonzero bending stiffness.

\Hypertarget{index_solid_bound}%
The two \char`\"{}types\char`\"{} of \char`\"{}generalised\char`\"{} positional degrees of freedom are accessible via the function {\ttfamily Node\+::x\+\_\+gen(k,i)}, where {\ttfamily Node\+::x\+\_\+gen(0,i)} $ \equiv $ {\ttfamily Node\+::x(i)}. The two types of positional degrees of freedom correspond to the two types of boundary conditions (pinned and clamped) that can be applied at the ends of the beam. Mathematically, the number of boundary conditions reflects the fact that the Euler-\/\+Lagrange equations of the variational principle are of fourth-\/order.

The nodes of solid mechanics elements are {\ttfamily Solid\+Nodes}, a generalisation of the basic {\ttfamily Node} class that allows the nodal positions to be treated as unknowns. Its member function {\ttfamily Solid\+Node\+::pin\+\_\+position(...)} allows the application of boundary conditions for the (generalised) nodal positions.

The {\ttfamily Hermite\+Beam\+Element} provides default values for all non-\/dimensional physical parameters\+:

\item the non-\/dimensional beam thickness $ h $ is 1/20.

\item the non-\/dimensional traction vector $ {\bf f} $ evaluates to zero.
\end{DoxyItemize}These values can be over-\/written via suitable access functions. \mbox{[}Time-\/dependent computations also require the specification of a timestepper for the elements.

\hypertarget{index_results}{}\doxysection{Results}\label{index_results}
The animation shown below illustrates the deformation of the beam under increasing pressure. An increase in pressure initially deflects the beam vertically downwards. The pressure acts as a \char`\"{}follower load\char`\"{} since it always acts in the direction normal to the deformed beam. This causes the beam to deform into an approximately circular shape whose radius increases rapidly.

\hypertarget{index_approx}{}\doxysection{An approximate analytical solution}\label{index_approx}
Before discussing the details of the numerical solution, we will derive an approximate analytical solution of the problem. The analytical solution will be useful to validate the computational results, and the derivation will allow us to discuss certain aspects of the theory in more detail.

We start by parametrising the beam\textquotesingle{}s undeformed shape as \[ {\bf r}_w(\xi) = \left( \begin{array}{c} \xi \\ 0 \end{array} \right) \mbox{ \ \ \ \ where $\xi \in [0,L].$} \] The 1x1 \char`\"{}metric tensor\char`\"{} associated with this parametrisation is given by \[ a = \frac{{\bf r}_w(\xi)}{d\xi} \cdot \frac{{\bf r}_w(\xi)}{d\xi} = 1, \] consistent with the fact that the Lagrangian coordinate $ \xi $ is the arclength along the beam\textquotesingle{}s undeformed centreline.

If the beam is thin (so that $ h \ll 1 $) bending effects will be confined to thin boundary layers near its ends. The beam will therefore behave (approximately) like a \char`\"{}string under tension\char`\"{} and its deformed shape will be an arc of a circle. All material line elements will be stretched by the same amount so that the tension is spatially uniform. The position vector to the material particles on the beam\textquotesingle{}s deformed centreline is therefore given by \[ {\bf R}_w(\xi) = \left( \begin{array}{c} \frac{1}{2}\left(1+\frac{\sin(-\alpha/2+\alpha\xi/L)} {\sin(\alpha/2)}\right) \\ \frac{\cos(-\alpha/2+\alpha\xi/L)-\cos(\alpha/2)} {2\sin(\alpha/2)} \end{array} \right) \mbox{ \ \ \ \ where $\xi \in [0,L].$} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3) \] (See the \mbox{\hyperlink{index_comments}{Exercises and Comments}} for a more detailed discussion of this analytical solution.) Here $ \alpha $ is the opening angle of the circular arc as shown in this sketch\+:

This deformation generates a uniform stretch of \[ \frac{dS}{ds} = \sqrt{\frac{A}{a}} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\alpha}{\sin(\alpha/2)}, \] corresponding to a uniform strain \[ \gamma = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sin^2(\alpha/2)} - 1 \right). \] The incremental Hooke\textquotesingle{}s law predicts a linear relation between the (2nd Piola Kirchhoff) stress, $ \sigma $, and the (Green) strain, $ \gamma $, so that \[ \sigma = \sigma_0 + \gamma, \] where $ \sigma_0 $ is the axial pre-\/stress that acts in the undeformed configuration.

An elementary force balance shows that the pressure $ p_{ext} $ required to deform the beam into the shape specified by (3), is given by \char`\"{}\+Laplace\textquotesingle{}s law\char`\"{} ~\newline
 \[ p_{ext} =\frac{{\tt T}}{R} \] where \[ R = \frac{L}{2 \sin(\alpha/2)} \] is the radius of the circular arc, and the axial tension $ {\tt T} $ is given by \[ {\tt T} = h \ (\sigma_0 + \gamma) \ \left|\frac{d{\bf R}_w}{d\xi}\right| = h \ (\sigma_0 + \gamma) \ \sqrt{A}. \] In this expression we have used the fact that the 2nd Piola Kirchhoff stress $ \sigma $ decomposes the (physical) stress vector into the vector $ d{\bf R}_w/d\xi $. This vector is tangent to the deformed centreline but not necessarily a unit vector.

The pressure required to deform the beam into a circular arc with opening angle $ \alpha $ is therefore given by \[ p_{ext} = \frac{\alpha h}{L} \ \left(\sigma_0 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sin^2(\alpha/2)} - 1 \right) \right). \]

To facilitate comparisons with the numerical solutions, we determine the opening angle $ \alpha $ as a function of the vertical displacement $ d $ of the beam\textquotesingle{}s midpoint by determining the auxiliary angle $ \beta $ from \[ \tan\beta = \frac{2d}{L}. \] The opening angle then follows from \[ \tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \tan(\pi - 2\beta) = - \tan 2\beta = \frac{2\tan\beta}{\tan^{2}\beta -1}. \]

Here is a comparison between the computed and analytically predicted values for the pressure $ p_{ext} $, required to deflect the beam\textquotesingle{}s midpoint by the specified displacement, $ d $.

\begin{center}{\bfseries{Comment\+: Geometric and constitutive nonlinearities}}\end{center}  The comparison between the computational results and the analytical predictions is very satisfying but is important to realise that the agreement only validates the numerical solution, not the physical model. {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} {\ttfamily Hermite\+Beam\+Element} is based on a {\bfseries{geometrically}} {\bfseries{nonlinear}} theory, implying that the kinematics of the deformation are captured exactly for arbitrarily large displacements and rotations. However, the use of {\bfseries{incrementally}} {\bfseries{linear}} {\bfseries{constitutive}} {\bfseries{equations}} in the variational principle (1) can only be justified if the strain is small. This is clearly not the case for the deformations shown above. The combination of geometric nonlinearity with linear constitutive equations can, however, be justified in applications in which the beam undergoes large displacements with little extension of its centreline. This typically occurs in stability problems, such as the \href{../../steady_ring/html/index.html}{\texttt{ buckling of a circular ring under external pressure}}, considered in \href{../../steady_ring/html/index.html}{\texttt{ another example}}.

In the present problem, the functions {\ttfamily Problem\+::actions\+\_\+before\+\_\+newton\+\_\+solve()} and {\ttfamily Problem\+::actions\+\_\+after\+\_\+newton\+\_\+solve()} are not required, so remain empty.

This avoids explicit re-\/casts when member functions of the specific mesh need to be accessed.

The class also includes three private data members which store a pointer to a node at which the displacement is documented, the length of the domain, and a pointer to the geometric object that specifies the beam\textquotesingle{}s undeformed shape.

 We then construct the a one-\/dimensional Lagrangian mesh in two-\/dimensional space, using the previously-\/constructed geometric object to set the initial positions of the nodes.

 The {\ttfamily One\+DLagrangian\+Mesh} is a {\ttfamily Solid\+Mesh} whose constituent nodes are {\ttfamily Solid\+Nodes}. These nodes store not only their (variable) 2D Eulerian position, accessible via {\ttfamily Solid\+Node\+::x(...)}, but also their (fixed) 1D Lagrangian coordinates, accessible via {\ttfamily Solid\+Node\+::xi(...)}. The {\ttfamily One\+DLagrangian\+Mesh} constructor assigns the nodes\textquotesingle{} Lagrangian coordinate, $ \xi $, by spacing them evenly in the range $ \xi \in [0,L] $. The {\ttfamily Geom\+Object} pointed to by {\ttfamily Undef\+\_\+beam\+\_\+pt}, provides a parametrisation of the beam\textquotesingle{}s undeformed shape in the form $ {\bf r}(\xi) $, and this is used to determine the nodes\textquotesingle{}s initial Eulerian position.

 We choose a node near the centre of the beam to monitor the displacements.

\hypertarget{index_param}{}\doxysection{The Parameter Study}\label{index_param}
The function \mbox{\hyperlink{classElasticBeamProblem_a2da3cb02ce953da67fb27742e20774a5}{Elastic\+Beam\+Problem\+::parameter\+\_\+study()}} is used to perform a parameter study, computing the beam\textquotesingle{}s deformation for a range of external pressures. During the solution of this particular problem, the maximum residual in the Newton iteration can be greater than the default maximum value of 10.\+0. We increase the default value by assigning a (much) larger value to {\ttfamily Problem\+::\+Max\+\_\+residuals}.

Next, we choose the increment in the control parameter (the external pressure), set its initial value and open an output file that will contain the value of the external pressure, the mid-\/point displacement and external pressure computed from the analytical solution. We also create an output stream and a string that will be used to write the complete solution for each value of the external pressure.

In the loop, we increment the external pressure $ P_{ext} $, solve the problem, calculate the analytical prediction for the pressure that is required to achieve the computed deformation, plot the solution and write the pressure, the displacement and exact pressure to the trace file.

\item Modify the code so that one end of the beam is no longer fixed in space. What happens? Why?
\item Increase the bending effects by increasing the beam\textquotesingle{}s thickness to $ h=0.1 $, say, and by \char`\"{}clamping\char`\"{} its ends, so that $ d({\bf R}_w(\xi)\cdot {\bf e}_y)/d\xi = 0 $ at $ \xi=0 $ and $ \xi=L $. This condition can be enforced by pinning the \char`\"{}type 1\char`\"{} (slope) positional degree of freedom in the vertical (1) direction at both ends; this requires the insertion of the statement 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mesh\_pt()-\/>boundary\_node\_pt(b,0)-\/>pin\_position(1,1); }

\end{DoxyCode}
 in the loop in the {\ttfamily Problem} constructor. You will have to adjust the number of elements to fully resolve the bending boundary layers.
\item {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} default\label{index_newton_cust}%
\Hypertarget{index_newton_cust}%
nonlinear solver, {\ttfamily Problem\+::newton\+\_\+solve(...)}, provides an implementation of the Newton method, which has the attractive feature that it converges quadratically -- provided a good initial guess for the solution is available. Good initial guesses can often (usually?) be generated by computing the solution via a sequence of substeps, as in the above example where we started with a known solution (the undeformed beam -- the exact solution for $ p_{ext} = p_{ext}^{(0)} =0 $ ) and used it as the initial guess for the solution at a small external pressure, $ p_{ext}^{(1)} $. When the Newton method converged, we used the computed solution as the initial guess for the solution at a slightly larger pressure, $ p_{ext}^{(2)} $, etc. If the increase in the load (or some other control parameter) is too large, the Newton method will diverge. To avoid unnecessary computations, the Newton iteration is terminated if\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the number of iterations exceeds {\ttfamily Problem\+::\+Max\+\_\+newton\+\_\+iterations} (which has a default value of 10)
\item the residual exceeds {\ttfamily Problem\+::\+Max\+\_\+residuals} (which has a default value of 10.\+0)
\end{DoxyItemize}The Newton method continues until the maximum residual has been reduced to {\ttfamily Problem\+::\+Newton\+\_\+solver\+\_\+tolerance}, which has a default value of $ 10^{-8} $. ~\newline
~\newline
 All three values are protected data members of the {\ttfamily Problem} base class and can therefore be changed in any specific {\ttfamily Problem}. For instance, in the problem considered above, the undeformed beam provides a poor approximation of its equilibrium shape at the first pressure value. The Newton method still converges (very slowly initially, then quadratically as it approaches the exact solution), even though the initial maximum residual has a relatively large value of 19.\+6. Here are some exercises that explore the convergence characteristics of the Newton method\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Experiment with the Newton solver and find the largest value for the load increment, {\ttfamily pext\+\_\+increment}, for which the Newton method still converges.
\item Explain why the Newton method converges very slowly for small values of $ p_{ext} $ and much more rapidly at larger values, even though the load increment, {\ttfamily pext\+\_\+increment}, remains constant.
\item Compare the solutions for different values of {\ttfamily Problem\+::\+Newton\+\_\+solver\+\_\+tolerance}. Is the default value ~\newline
 $ 10^{-8} $ adequate? Reduce it to $ 10^{-12} $ and $ 10^{-18} $. What do you observe? ~\newline
