\mainpage Refineable Boussinesq Convection using a multi-domain approach: Combining (Refineable) Navier--Stokes and Advection-Diffusion domains

approach. We illustrate the methodology

two-dimensional Boussinesq convection problem in
which an incompressible, Newtonian fluid is heated from below.

\section setting_up Part I: The overall framework for handling multi-domain interactions



When two or more physical processes interact within the same spatial
domain there are three different approaches to setting up the
interaction within \c oomph-lib. One approach is to write a completely
new element that discretises all the PDEs involved in the problem. 
The second approach, described in the tutorials discussing the
<a  href="../../b_convection/html/index.html"> the non-refineable  </a> and 
<a href="../../refine_b_convect/html/index.html">refineable </a> 
solution of the Boussinesq convection problem, is to create a 
combined multi-physics element using inheritance from two, or more, existing
elements. In both these cases, the physical processes and their
associated fields interact within a single element and we refer
to this methodology as a \b multi-field approach.

In this tutorial we describe a third approach to multi-physics
problems, in which we solve the problem using two different types of elements 
on two different meshes (domains), each occupying the same 
physical space.  Rather than interacting locally 
within elements, the different physical processes interact 
directly between the two domains, so that, in 
the Boussinesq convection problem considered here, each 
advection-diffusion element obtains the "wind" from the (separate) 
Navier-Stokes element that occupies the same position, while 
the Navier-Stokes elements obtain the temperature
required for the computation of the buoyancy force from the
corresponding advection-diffusion element.


One benefit of this \b multi-domain approach, compared to a \b
multi-field approach, is that different error estimators can be 
used on each domain and there is no longer a need to construct 
a combined multi-physics error estimator; see the 
<a href="../../refine_b_convect/html/index.html">tutorial for the
adaptive solution of the Boussinesq convection problem</a> for more
details on this issue. Moreover, the meshes do not
have to have the same refinement pattern, which can be
advantageous if the different physical processes act over different
spatial scales. The figure below shows that in the Boussinesq 
convection problem the Navier--Stokes mesh (panel (a)) requires much more
refinement than the advection-diffusion mesh (panel (b)).

\subsection external_elements The ElementWithExternalElement class

 Interaction between different elements in different domains is a
fundamental feature of many multi-physics problems and the generic
functionality to deal with such interactions is provided by the \c
ElementWithExternalElement class.  Any element that requires 
information from an "external element" should therefore inherit from the
base class \c ElementWithExternalElement.  

"External elements" typically provide source-like terms for the
\c ElementWithExternalElement. For instance, in the Boussinesq
convection problem studied here,
the advection-diffusion element is the "external element" for
the Navier-Stokes element because it affects the body force
in the Navier-Stokes equations; in a fluid-structure interaction 
problem, the Navier-Stokes elements that are adjacent to the
fluid-loaded elastic wall act as the "external elements" for the
\c FSIWallElement because they determine the traction that the fluid
exerts onto the wall; etc.

 Within a finite-element context, the effect of the "external element" 
onto the \c ElementWithExternalElement typically has to be evaluated
at the integration points of the \c ElementWithExternalElement.
Therefore, the \c ElementWithExternalElement base class provides
storage for a pointer to an "external element" (and the local coordinate
within it) for each integration point. Access to this information
is provided via the member functions


\code
FiniteElement*& ElementWithExternalElement::external_element_pt(
                                const unsigned& interaction, 
                                const unsigned& ipt);
\endcode

and

\code
Vector<double>& ElementWithExternalElement::external_element_local_coord(
                      const unsigned& interaction, 
                      const unsigned& ipt);
\endcode

For a given integration point, \c ipt, within the \c
ElementWithExternalElement, these functions 
identify the corresponding point in the "external element" by
returning a pointer to the "external element" and the local coordinate 
within it, respectively.
The unsigned parameter \c interaction denotes the interaction
index, required to allow for cases where an element interacts with more
than one "external element". This occurs, for instance, in double-diffusive
convection problems (discussed in  <a href="../../../../demo_drivers/multi_physics/double_diffusive_convection/multimesh_dd_convection.cc">
a separate demo driver code </a>), in which the body force 
in the Navier-Stokes equations is affected by two physical properties,
<em> e.g.</em> temperature and salinity, both of which are transported by
separate advection-diffusion processes; 
or in FSI problems where a beam or shell element is
affected by a fluid load on both its "front" and "back" (see, e.g., the 
<a href="../../../interaction/fsi_channel_with_leaflet/html/index.html">FSI 
channel with leaflet problem</a>).

\c Data that affects the fields in the "external elements" 
must be specified so that the off-diagonal blocks in the 
\c ElementWithExternalElement's Jacobian matrix (representing the
derivatives of the \c ElementWithExternalElement's residual vector
with respect to the \c Data in the "external elements")
can be calculated. We divide such data into two categories:
- <em> External field data: </em> all \c Data that affects the 
fields through which the "external element" interacts with the
\c ElementWithExternalElement.
.
- <em> External geometric data: </em> all geometric \c Data that affects
the shape and position of the "external element" and, therefore, spatial 
derivatives of its fields. 
.
The rationale for this division is that in many cases the field 
data's contribution to the interaction blocks in the Jacobian matrix
can be found analytically, whereas the geometric
data is more easily handled by finite differencing.

Both types of external data are determined (automatically) by two member
functions of the \c ElementWithExternalElement. The first one,

\code
virtual void  ElementWithExternalElement::identify_all_field_data_for_external_interaction(
    Vector<std::set<FiniteElement*> > const &external_elements_pt,
    std::set<std::pair<Data*,unsigned> > &paired_interaction_data); 
\endcode

determines the external field data that affect the (possibly multiple) 
interactions in the \c ElementWithExternalElement. Given the vector 
\c external_elements_pt (within which  <code> external_elements_pt[i] </code>
contains the set of pointers to the "external elements"
involved in the \c ElementWithExternalElement's \c i -th interaction), the 
function returns a set of pairs, each of which comprises a
pointer to a \c Data object and an unsigned that identifies a value
within it. The default implementation of this function includes
\b all field data of \b all "external elements", using calls to

\code
void FiniteElement::identify_field_data_for_interactions(...)
\endcode

for each "external element". Similarly, the function

\code
virtual void  ElementWithExternalElement::identify_all_geometric_data_for_external_interaction(
    Vector<std::set<FiniteElement*> >  const &external_elements_pt,
    std::set<Data*> &external_geometric_data_pt);
\endcode   

returns the set of \b all \c Data that affect the shape or position of any
of the "external elements" specified by the vector \c
external_elements_pt. Again, this function has a default
implementation that determines \b all geometric Data associated
with "external elements" by calling

\code
void FiniteElement::identify_geometric_data(..)
\endcode

for each "external element".

We note that the default implementation of these functions can 
(and, where possible, should) be overloaded to exclude data values
that do not actually contribute to the interaction. For instance,
in the Boussinesq convection problem considered here, the
advection-diffusion elements are only affected by the
velocity degrees of freedom in the Navier-Stokes elements but
not by the pressures. Our re-implementation of \c
ElementWithExternalElement::identify_all_field_data_for_external_interaction(...)
in the multi-domain advection-diffusion element for the Boussinesq problem
therefore excludes the pressure degrees of freedom, see
<a href="#optimise"><b>Part IV</b></a>.

<HR>

\subsection off_diag_jac Computation of the Jacobian matrix

Most single-physics elements already provide functions 
to compute their own Jacobians analytically. These functions compute the
derivatives of the element's residual vector with respect to the 
element's "own" degrees of freedom (e.g. the fluid velocity and pressure in a
Navier-Stokes element). The interaction with the "external element"
introduces additional dependencies because the element's residual vector
now also depends on the unknowns associated with the "external
elements". The derivatives of the element's residual
vector with respect to these unknowns must therefore be included into the
computation of the element's Jacobian matrix. 


To maximise code re-use, we follow the approach discussed in 
the <a href="../../b_convection/html/index.html#comments">
comments </a> section of the single-domain version of the problem 
and re-use the underlying element's \c fill_in_contribution_to_jacobian(...) 
function, while employing finite-differencing to evaluate the derivatives
of the element's residual vector with respect to the unknowns
associated with the "external elements". This is done most easily by
using the function

\code
ElementWithExternalElement::fill_in_jacobian_from_external_interaction_by_fd(..)
\endcode

which computes the derivatives of the element's
residual vector with respect to external field and external geometric
data by calls to the two functions

\code
ElementWithExternalElement::fill_in_jacobian_from_external_interaction_field_by_fd(..)
\endcode

and

\code
ElementWithExternalElement::fill_in_jacobian_from_external_interaction_geometric_by_fd(..)
\endcode

If, in a particular problem, it is known that the interaction is not
affected by the position or shape of the "external elements" (<em>
i.e. </em>  if
the interaction terms do not involve spatial derivatives of the
"external element's" field variables) the unnecessary computation of the 
derivatives with respect to the "external element's" geometric data
may be suppressed using a call to

\code
ElementWithExternalElement::ignore_external_geometric_data();
\endcode

Depending on the complexity of the interaction terms, it may be
worthwhile to provide a function that computes the off-diagonal
blocks analytically. This is discussed in more detail in
<a href="#optimise"><b>Part IV</b></a>.


<HR>

\subsection setting_up_interaction Setting up the interaction

The namespace \c Multi_domain_functions provides numerous helper
functions that facilitate the setup of multi-domain interactions.
Specifically, the function 
\c Multi_domain_functions::setup_multi_domain_interactions(...)
can be used to identify the "external elements" in a two-way
interaction between two meshes. The function has the following
interface:

\code
  template<class ELEMENT_0,class ELEMENT_1>     
  void setup_multi_domain_interactions(Problem* problem_pt, 
                                       Mesh* const &first_mesh_pt,
                                       Mesh* const &second_mesh_pt,
                                       const unsigned& first_interaction=0,
                                       const unsigned& second_interaction=0);
\endcode

Here \c first_mesh_pt and \c second_mesh_pt point to the two
interacting meshes whose elements (of type \c ELEMENT_0 and
\c ELEMENT_1, respectively), must be derived
from the \c ElementWithExternalElement class. 
The optional interaction parameters may be used to specify 
which interaction is set up in each mesh. If the parameter is not specified
it defaults to zero, appropriate if there is
only a single interaction.

The function must be called prior to the assignment of the equation 
numbers, and then again whenever either of the two meshes has changed, 
<em> e.g.</em> after a mesh adaptation.

\section implement_boussinesq Part II: Implementing multi-domain interaction elements for the Boussinesq convection problem 

We illustrate the general procedures discussed above
by demonstrating how to upgrade existing single-physics
Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion elements to \c ElementWithExternalElements
that can be used for the multi-domain-based solution of the 
Boussinesq convection problem. 

<HR>

\subsection nst Upgrading the Navier-Stokes element to an ElementWithExternalElement 


We use multiple inheritance to upgrade an existing refineable 
Navier-Stokes element to a \c RefineableNavierStokesBoussinesqElement
in which the temperature that affects the body force is given by
an "external" advection-diffusion element. To facilitate code reuse
we employ templating to specify the types of the Navier-Stokes and
advection diffusion elements. 

\dontinclude multi_domain_boussinesq_elements.h
\skipline nst_bous_class
\until
{

 
The constructor calls the constructors of the underlying elements, 
initialises the pointer to the Rayleigh number (stored as private
member data in the class) and sets the number of interactions to one,
indicating that the residuals of the Navier-Stokes element are only
affected by a single type of "external element" -- the advection-diffusion
element that determines the temperature distribution. 

\until }

We provide access functions to the Rayleigh number

\until }

#return Ra_pt;}

and, given that we are dealing with a refineable element, 
make sure that the pointer to the Rayleigh number is passed to the
"son" elements when the element is refined. Furthermore, if
the external geometric data could safely be ignored in the "father"
elements we assume that the same is true for the "sons":

\until }

The most important step is to overload the function 
that computes the body force in the Navier-Stokes equations so that
it depends on the temperature at the \c ipt -th integration 
point, as computed by the "external element": 

\dontinclude multi_domain_boussinesq_elements.h
\skipline  Overload get_body_force_nst
\until end overloaded body force

There is only one external interaction so the interaction index is
set to zero and the value of the temperature at the integration point
is obtained by casting the external element to an advection diffusion
element and finding its interpolated field at the
appropriate stored local coordinate. Once the temperature has been
obtained, the code is identical to that discussed in the
 <a href="../../b_convection/html/index.html">tutorial for 
the corresponding multi-field implementation</a>; in that
implementation the temperature could be found from a member function 
because the interaction is internal to the element.

Finally, we have to compute the element's Jacobian matrix. 
The easiest (although potentially inefficient) 
way to do this is to recycle the 
analytical computation of the derivatives of the Navier-Stokes 
residuals with respect to the fluid degrees of
freedom, as implemented in  
\c NST_ELEMENT::fill_in_contribution_to_jacobian(...),

\dontinclude multi_domain_boussinesq_elements.h
\skipline Compute the element's residual vector and 
\until fill_in_contribution_to_jacobian(residuals, jacobian);

and then fill in the derivatives with respect to 
the degrees of freedom associated with the "external
elements" by finite differencing:
 
\until else
 
If this is deemed to be too inefficient, we can provide a function
that computes the required entries in the Jacobian analytically:

\until }


(The code illustrates both approaches and employs
the macro  \c 
USE_FD_FOR_DERIVATIVES_WRT_EXTERNAL_DATA_IN_MULTI_DOMAIN_BOUSSINESQ
to choose which one to use.)

We
refer to <a href="#optimise"><b>Part IV</b></a>  for a discussion of how to
implement the fully-analytic computation of the
Jacobian matrix in the function \c fill_in_off_diagonal_block_analytic(...).


<HR>

<HR>

\subsection ad Upgrading the advection-diffusion element to an ElementWithExternalElement 


Upgrading the advection-diffusion element to an \c
ElementWithExternalElement in which the wind is given by the
"external" Navier Stokes element follows the same procedure.
We use multiple inheritance to construct the element and
set the number of interactions to one:

\dontinclude multi_domain_boussinesq_elements.h
\skipline ad_bous_class
\until }


We overload the function that computes the "wind" for the advection
diffusion equations so that it is given by the fluid
velocity at the \c ipt -th integration point, as computed by 
the "external element": 

\dontinclude multi_domain_boussinesq_elements.h
\skipline  Overload the wind
\until } // end of get_wind_adv_diff

Again, there is only one external interaction so the interaction index
is set to zero and the external element
must be cast to a Navier-Stokes element so that the interpolated
velocity field can be found. The code is similar to that used in the
<a href="../../b_convection/html/index.html">
multi-field implementation</a>, which uses internal, rather than external, 
interaction.

The element's Jacobian matrix can be computed by the
same methods discussed for the Navier-Stokes elements:

\skipline Compute the element
\until }

\section multi_domain_boussinesq Part III: The driver code for the multi-domain Boussinesq problem


Using the upgraded elements discussed above, 
<A HREF="../../../../demo_drivers/multi_physics/boussinesq_convection/multi_domain_ref_b_convection.cc">the driver code </a>
for the multi-domain-based solution of the Boussinesq convection
problem is very similar to that of the 
<a href="../../refine_b_convect/html/index.html">
single-domain example.</a> Indeed, the \c main() functions are virtually
identical. The only difference is that the \c
RefineableConvectionProblem takes two template arguments (specifying
the two different element types) instead of one (specifying the
type of the single, combined element).

<HR>

\subsection problem_class The problem class

The problem class is similar to that of the
<a href="../../refine_b_convect/html/index.html">single-domain example
</a> and many of the functions are the same. 
There are now two meshes, however, one for the
fluid elements and one for the advection-diffusion elements:

\dontinclude multi_domain_ref_b_convection.cc
\skipline Access function to the NST mesh
\until end_of_nst_mesh

\skipline Access function to the AD mesh
\until  end_of_ad_mesh

and after any mesh adaptation, the
interaction between the two meshes must be set up again.

\skipline Actions after adapt
\until end_of_actions_after_adapt

<HR>

\subsection constructor The Problem constructor

The problem constructor is slightly different from the equivalent
single-domain version, mainly because there are two meshes instead of
one. Firstly, we build two coarse meshes with the same number of
elements (\f$ 9 \times 8 \f$, as in the original single-domain problem) and
dimensions for each mesh. Error estimators and error targets are set
separately for each mesh. 

\dontinclude multi_domain_ref_b_convection.cc
\skipline start_of_constructor
\until Adv_diff_mesh_pt->min_permitted_error

The boundary constraints are applied to each mesh in turn; firstly on
the Navier--Stokes mesh, where we must also pin a single pressure:

\skipline Set the boundary conditions
\until fix_pressure

We then apply boundary constraints to the advection-diffusion mesh:

\skipline Loop over the boundaries of the AD mesh
\until end of loop over AD mesh boundaries

and complete the build of all elements in each mesh by setting the
pointers to the required physical parameters in each domain.
Since neither of the interaction terms involves spatial derivatives
of the field variables in the "external elements", we can ignore
the derivatives with respect to the external geometric data
when computing the element's Jacobian matrix. This is done
by the calls to \c ElementWithExternalElement::ignore_external_geometric_data();

\skipline Complete the build of all elements
\until end of setup for all AD elements

Finally we combine the submeshes,
set up the interaction between the two meshes, and
assign the equation numbers.

\skipline combine the submeshes
\until end of constructor

<HR>

\subsection actions_before_newton_solve The function actions_before_newton_solve(...)

In this function we update the problem specifications before a
solution by re-applying the specific values of the Dirichlet boundary
conditions for each mesh, and ensuring that the mass-conserving
imperfection is applied to the velocity boundary conditions on the
Navier--Stokes mesh if required. The boundary conditions are exactly
the same as for the  <a href="../../b_convection/html/index.html">
single-domain version of the problem</a>, but they
must be applied differently because there are now two meshes instead
of one.

\dontinclude multi_domain_ref_b_convection.cc
\skipline start_actions_before_newton_solve

\subsection doc_solution The function doc_solution(...)

This function outputs all fields to the specified solution file in the
directory pointed to by the \c DocInfo object.

\section optimise Part IV: Optimising multi-domain interactions
We showed in <a href="#implement_boussinesq"><b>Part II</b></a>
that only a small number of functions <b> must </b> be implemented to upgrade
an existing single-physics element to an \c ElementWithExternalElement
that can interact with another element in a different domain. This is
because much of the required functionality is already implemented 
in the \c ElementWithExternalElement base class, which makes
the implementation of multi-physics interactions very easy. The 
use of general-purpose functions may incur unnecessary computational
cost, however. Hence, a better efficiency can be achieved by
overloading certain functions when implementing a specific 
\c ElementWithExternalElement.

<HR>

\subsection restricting_field_data Ignoring field data that does not participate in the interaction 

The function
\c ElementWithExternalElement::identify_all_field_data_for_external_interaction(...)
assumes that \b all data values in the external elements affect
the interaction with the \c ElementWithExternalElement. In many
cases this assumption is overly pessimistic (and costly). For
instance in the Boussinesq convection problem only the velocity 
degrees of freedom in the (external) Navier-Stokes element affect
the the advection-diffusion equations via the "wind". It is therefore
sensible to exclude the pressure degrees of freedom from the
interaction by re-implementing 
\c identify_all_field_data_for_external_interaction(...) as follows

\dontinclude multi_domain_boussinesq_elements.h
\skipline optimised_identification_of_field_data
\until // done

Similar approaches can be used to ignore selected (weak) interactions 
when computing the element's Jacobian matrix. For instance, 
the \c FSIWallElement is an \c ElementWithExternalElement
for which the adjacent fluid elements that apply the fluid
traction to the FSI boundary act as "external elements". 
In high-Reynolds-number flows, the fluid traction is dominated
by the pressure while shear stresses tend to be small. The \c FSIWallElement
therefore uses the same mechanism as illustrated above to (optionally)
neglect the derivatives of its residuals with respect to the fluid
velocity degrees of freedom. We stress that this does not exclude
the shear stress from the computation -- it simply replaces the
exact Jacobian by an approximate version in which the effect
of the velocity degrees of freedom on the residuals of the \c
FSIWallElement are neglected. This may lead to a slight degradation 
in the convergence rate of the Newton iteration but this may be
more than compensated for by the reduction in the CPU times required to
compute the Jacobian matrix.

<HR>

\subsection restricting_geom_data Ignoring geometric data

If the interaction with the "external element" does not involve
spatial derivatives of the fields represented by the "external element"
or if the mesh containing the "external elements" is fixed, the
external geometric data associated with the "external elements" can
be ignored when computing the \c ElementWithExternalElement's 
Jacobian. This may be achieved by calling

\code
ElementWithExternalElement::ignore_external_geometric_data();
\endcode

<HR>

\subsection analytical_jacobian Computing the off-diagonal blocks in the Jacobian analytically

The setup of the Jacobian matrix can be made much more efficient
by computing the derivatives of the \c ElementWithExternalElements'
residual vector with respect to the field data in the associated
"external elements" analytically. The multi-domain driver codes in 

<CENTER>
<A HREF="../../../../demo_drivers/multi_physics/boussinesq_convection">
demo_drivers/multi_physics/boussinesq_convection
</A>
</CENTER>

demonstrate a possible implementation. The key challenge for the
implementation is that the \c ElementWithExternalElement must label the entries
in its elemental Jacobian matrix by its local equation 
numbers, whereas the "external element" can only compute the
derivative of its fields with respect to its own (differently numbered) 
local degrees of freedom (d.o.f.s). To establish which local d.o.f. in the
"external element" corresponds to a given local d.o.f.
in the \c ElementWithExternalElement we exchange the (unique) global
equation numbers associated with each d.o.f. Using this trick, the
computation of the derivatives becomes relatively straightforward.
Mathematically, it involves repeated applications of the chain rule. 
In the cases we considered, the fully-analytic computation of the
elemental Jacobian matrix was about 3 to 4 times faster than 
finite-difference-based computation implemented in the
\c ElementWithExternalElement base class. Whether the speedup is
worth the additional (human) time required to implement the
analytic computation of the off-diagonal entries depends on 
the application (and you!). If nothing else, the availability of a
finite-difference based routine helps in the validation of any
newly-developed analytic re-implementation.

\section comm_and_ex Comments and Exercises
\subsection comments Comments
- The use of two separate meshes with different error estimators means
that, in principle, a more accurate solution can be obtained with
fewer degrees of freedom than using a combined error estimator on a
single mesh. The combined error estimator implemented in the
<a href="../../refine_b_convect/html/index.html">single-domain
version of the problem </a> will cause refinement if either the fluid
error or the advection-diffusion error is above the
specified tolerance. Thus, a fully-converged solution in the
single-domain problem is one in which the estimated error in 
all field variables is below the tolerance, but this may be at the
cost of some over-refinement in one or more of the field variables. In
the present multi-domain approach, if the solution is converged on
both meshes then the estimated error in all field variables is again
below the tolerance. Hence, it is fair, in some sense, to 
compare the results between fully-converged
solutions for the single- and multi-domain problems. As suggested by
the figure above, for the Boussinesq convection problem
considered here we do obtain fully-converged solutions
with fewer degrees of freedom using the multi-domain approach because
the temperature field is over-refined in the single-domain
case. Of course, the multi-domain solution includes the extra overhead
of setting up the interaction, but, in general, this cost is
negligible compared to the solution of the linear systems.
\n\n
- The general procedures described in this tutorial can be used to
set up any interaction between different types of elements using
multiple meshes. 
\n\n
- Before any refinements take place the combined Jacobian
is exactly the same as that in the single-domain problem and
so the residuals at each Newton step will be exactly the same. You can
verify this by comparing the appropriate output files in the
\c Validation  directory.
