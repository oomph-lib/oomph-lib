\mainpage Demo problem: Flow of a fluid film down an inclined plane

 The two-dimensional flow of a free surface down an inclined plane is
 a simple exact solution of the Navier--Stokes equations. We describe
 two different ways of solving the problem using either spines or a
 pseudo-elastic method to define the bulk mesh motion.

\section form Problem formulation

@I w 0.75\textwidth sketch "A film of incompressible viscous fluid of a given thickness flows down a plane inclined at a prescribed angle to the gravitational field. "

 Formulating the problem in coordinates tangential (\f$x^{*}\f$) and
 normal (\f$y^{*}\f$) to the plane and assuming that the flow is steady
 and only in the tangential direction, but independent of the tangential
 coordinate, reduces the momentum equations to 
  
<CENTER>
\f[ \frac{\partial p^*}{\partial x^*}  = \rho \,g \sin\alpha +
\mu\,\frac{\partial^{2} u^*}{\partial y^{*2}}, \f]
\f[ \frac{\partial p^*}{\partial y^*} = -\rho \,g \cos\alpha, \f]
</CENTER>
where \f$u^*\f$ is the velocity component tangential to the plane and
\f$p^*\f$ is the fluid pressure. Note that 
the continuity equation is automatically satisfied. 

We non-dimensionalise using the only length-scale in the
problem \f$H\f$, choosing the viscous scale for the pressure and
choosing a reference velocity scale \f$U\f$:
\f[ x^{*} = H x,\qquad y^{*} = H y,\qquad u^* = U u,\qquad p^* = \mu
U/H,\f] 
and the governing equations become
<CENTER>
\f[ \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}  = \frac{\rho \,g H^{2}}{\mu U} \sin\alpha +
    \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial y^{2}} = \frac{Re}{Fr} \sin \alpha + 
    \frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial y^{2}}, \f]
\f[ \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} = -\frac{\rho \,g H^{2}}{\mu U} 
    \cos\alpha = - \frac{Re}{Fr} \cos\alpha. \f]
</CENTER>
The dimensionless grouping \f$ \rho g H^{2} / (\mu U) \f$ represents
the ratio of gravitational forces to viscous forces and we choose to
identify it as a Reynolds number \f$ Re = \rho U H / \mu\f$ divided by
a Froude number \f$ Fr = U^{2} / (g H)\f$. 

We proceed by assuming that the flow is driven entirely by the
gravitational body force and that there is no additional tangential 
pressure gradient. Then, integrating the tangential momentum balance
twice and using the boundary conditions of no-slip at the plane (\f$y=0\f$)and
that the free surface (\f$y=1\f$) is tangentially stress-free gives
\f[ u =  \frac{1}{2}\frac{Re}{Fr}\sin\alpha \left(2 y - y^{2}\right). \f]
Integrating the normal momentum balance and setting the reference
external pressure to be zero at the free surface gives
\f[ p = \frac{Re}{Fr}\cos\alpha (1 - y).\f]

Finally, we specify a "natural" velocity scale by setting \f$Re/Fr =
2\f$, corresponding to the velocity of the free-surface for a vertical
film (\f$\alpha = \pi/2\f$).

@I w 0.75\textwidth prof "Velocity profile and pressure contours for the flat-film solution for an inclination of 45 degrees. " 

We shall assess the stability of the flat-film solution by applying a
small perturbation to the interface and evolving the system in
time. If the interface is stable, the perturbation should decay, if
not it should grow.

\subsection bound A note on the boundary conditions

 Resolving the above analytic solution in a finite computational
domain requires some thought about boundary conditions. We are only
ever free to set one pressure value and setting the external pressure
to zero fixes the pressure within the fluid. The boundary conditions
at the plane are those of no-slip and at the free-surface 
the usual dynamic and kinematic conditions apply.
Nonetheless, we have a number of
possibilities for the boundary conditions at the "artifical" upstream
and downstream computational boundaries.
 - Prescribe periodic boundary conditions.
 - Prescribe the velocity profile as a Dirichlet condition at both
 ends.
 - Prescribe the appropriate hydrostatic pressure gradient and zero
 normal velocity.
.
 
We have chosen the last option, in which case the hydrostatic
 pressure gradient must be consistent with the external pressure. In
 other words, the pressure must be zero at the free surface
 (\f$y=0\f$). Changing the external pressure would correspond to
 changing the film thickness, so the external pressure is directly
 responsible for enforcing a specific volume constraint, unless 
 \f$\alpha = \pi/2\f$. When \f$\alpha = \pi/2\f$ there is no variation in 
  hydrostatic pressure through the film and its thickness is
  not specified by the external pressure.

\section global Global parameters and functions
 The global parameters are the Reynolds number, 
 the dimensionless grouping \f$Re/Fr\f$, the angle of inclination of
 the slope \f$\alpha\f$, the direction of the gravity vector \f$G\f$
 and the capillary number \f$Ca\f$, which only influences the dynamics.

\dontinclude inclined_plane.cc
\skipline Global_Physical_Variables
\until Ca=

 The hydrostatic pressure field is specified as an applied
 traction. At the outlet (inlet), the outer unit normal is in the 
 positive (negative)
 \f$x\f$ direction and so the required traction is given by \f$-p\f$
 (\f$p\f$),
 \f[ \mbox{\boldmath$t$}|_{\mbox{outlet}} = (- (Re/Fr)\cos\alpha (1 -
 y), 0), \qquad 
 \mbox{\boldmath$t$}|_{\mbox{inlet}} = ((Re/Fr)\cos\alpha (1 -
 y), 0).\f] 
 These tractions are specified by the two different functions
 \skipline outlet
 \until end of traction
 Note that \c G [ \c 1 ] is the component of the gravitational body force in
 the vertical direction, so \f$ G[1] = - \cos\alpha\f$.

\section main The driver code
 We start by specifying the constitutive law used to define the mesh
 motion when pseudo-elastic deformation is used.
\skipline start of main
\until ::E
 Next, the type of fluid element is 
 chosen according to specified compiler flags
\skipline CR_ELEMENT
\until #endif
 We then initialise the physical parameters, the Reynolds number and
 the direction of the gravitational body force, all based on the angle
 of inclination \f$\alpha\f$.
\skipline Initialise physical
\until G[1] 
 We now create the spine version of the problem, solve the steady
 problem, assign initial conditions by assuming that the problem has
 been at the steady state for all previous times, apply an initial
 perturbation and then evolve the system in time.
 \skipline Spine problem
 \until End of spine problem
 Finally, exactly the same procedure is performed for the elastic problem
 \skipline Elastic problem
 \until End of elastic problem

\section mesh The mesh classes
\subsection basic The generic mesh

 With the aim of explaining the difference between the spine-based and
 pseudo-solid formulations of mesh motion, all functionality
 common to both formulations is included in a generic mesh class.
 The geometry is based on the \c SimpleRectangularQuadMesh, but
 free-surface and traction elements must be added to the appropriate
 boundaries. The class \c InclinedPlaneMesh
 contains functions to add the appropriate \c FaceElements to the
 elements of the mesh. The class inherits from \c
 SimpleRectangularQuadMesh
 \dontinclude inclined_plane.cc
 \skipline A simple class
 \until end of constructor
 and contains two additional functions \c make_traction_elements() and
 \c make_free_surface_elements().
 
 The function \c make_traction_elements() creates
 \c NavierStokesTractionElement s adjacent to the mesh boundaries 3
 (the inlet) and 1 (the inlet). These elements are added to the list
 of elements stored in the mesh and pointers to the 
 appropriate traction functions are assigned.
 \skipline traction boundary elements
 \until end of make_traction_elements

 The function \c make_free_surface_elements() creates the appropriate 
\c INTERFACE_ELEMENTs adjacent to the free surface (boundary 2), sets 
the capillary number and also creates free-surface boundary elements
at the left- and right-hand ends of the interface. If these "point"
elements are not included then the surface tension is not
applied correctly at the edges of the domain. 
\skipline Make the free
\until end of make_free_surface_elements

\subsection spine_mesh Creating the spine mesh
The \c SpineInclinedPlaneMesh  inherits from the generic \c
InclinedPlaneMesh, specifying that the \c INTERFACE_ELEMENTs
are \c SpineLineFluidInterfaceElement s
and adds vertical spines to the Nodes
within the mesh. In addition the traction and free-surface elements
are created.
\skipline Convert
\until end of constructor
Finally, a \c spine_node_update() function must be provided that
determines how the \c Nodes move as functions of the \c Spines.
\skipline General node
\until }

\subsection elastic_mesh Creating the ElasticMesh

The \c ElasticInclinedPlaneMesh  inherits from the \c
InclinedPlaneMesh, 
specifying that the \c INTERFACE_ELEMENTs
are \c ElasticLineFluidInterfaceElement s. The traction and
free-surface elements are created and the undeformed (reference)
configuration is set to be the current position of the \c Nodes.
\skipline Convert
\until };
Note that the specification of the ElasticMesh is much simpler than
that of a SpineMesh because no decision needs to be taken about how to
describe the motion using Spines.

\section problem The problem classes
\subsection generic_prob The generic problem
 Again, for ease of exposition, all generic functionality is included
 in the \c InclinedPlaneProblem class, which, aside from the
 constructor, contains three functions and a single member datum: 
 a string \c Output_prefix, used to distinguish
 between the output files from different formulations.
 The function \c
 complete_build() assigns physical parameters to the fluid elements,
 sets the boundary conditions and assigns equation numbers.
 \dontinclude inclined_plane.cc
 \skipline complete_build(
 \until end of complete_build
 Note that boundary conditions for the nodal positions in the
 pseudo-elastic formulation are specified by testing whether the \c
 Nodes are \c SolidNodes. In this case, the \c Nodes on the
 inlet and outlet boundaries are constrained to remain at the same
 horizonal position and the \c Nodes on the plane wall are fixed. 

 The function \c solve_steady() initialises the velocity of at
 all \c Nodes to the flat-film solution, solves the steady equations
 and writes the solution to a file.
 \skipline :solve_steady()
 \until end of solve_steady

 Finally, the function \c timestep() takes a number of fixed timesteps
 writing vertical positions and the time to a trace file and writing
 the complete flow field to disk after a given number of timesteps.
\skipline timestep(
\until end of timestep

\subsection spine_prob The spine-based formulation

The class \c SpineInclinedPlaneProblem  inherits
from the generic \c InclinedPlaneProblem  class
and requires only minor modification. The constructor sets the string
\c Output_prefix, builds a timestepper, builds the specific \c
SpineMesh and then calls \c InclinedPlaneProblem::complete_build(). 
\skipline SpineInclinedPlaneProblem(
\until }

In a spine-based formulation, the nodal positions must be updated
after every Newton step, which is achieved by overloading the function
\c Problem::actions_before_newton_convergence_check()
\skipline Spine heights/
\until }

We also specify a destructor to clean up memory allocated by the
class.

\subsection elastic_probe The psuedo-solid-based formulation
The class \c ElasticInclinedPlaneProblem inherits from the generic \c
InclinedPlaneProblem class and also requires only minor
modification. The constructor sets te string \c Output_prefix, builds
a timestepper, builds the specific \c SolidMesh, sets the constitutive
law for the bulk elements and then calls \c
InclinedPlaneProblem::complete_build()
\skipline ElasticInclinedPlaneProblem(
\until end of constructor
 
In a pseudo-solid formulation, it is advantageous to reset the
undeformed configuration after every timestep (an updated Lagrangian
formulation). Hence, the \c Problem::actions_after_implicit_timestep()
function is overloaded
\skipline actions_after_implicit
\until  end of actions_

We also specify a destructor to clean up memory allocated by the
class.
