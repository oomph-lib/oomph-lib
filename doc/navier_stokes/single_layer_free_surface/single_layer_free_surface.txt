non-dimensionalisation of the free surface boundary conditions and
their implementation in \c oomph-lib, and demonstrate the solution of
a single layer relaxation problem.

\section free_surface_eqns Boundary conditions at a free surface

Free surfaces occur at the interface between two fluids. Such
interfaces require two boundary conditions to be applied:
-# a kinematic condition which relates the motion of the free
surface to the fluid velocities at the surface, and
-# a dynamic condition which is concerned with the force balance at
the free surface.

\subsection kinematic_condition_theory The kinematic condition

The kinematic condition states that the fluid particles at the surface
remain on the surface for all times. If the surface is parameterised
by intrinsic coordinates \f$ \zeta_1 \f$ and \f$ \zeta_2 \f$, then the
Eulerian position vector which describes the surface at a given time
\f$ t \f$ can be written as \f$ \mathbf{R}^* =
\mathbf{R}^*(\zeta_1,\zeta_2,t) \f$. The kinematic condition is then
given by 
\f[
\left(u_i^*-\frac{\partial R_i^*}{\partial t^*}\right) n_i = 0,
\f]
where \f$ \mathbf{u}^* \f$ is the (dimensional) velocity of the fluid
and \f$ \mathbf{n} \f$ is the outer unit normal to the free
surface. Using the same problem-specific reference quantities for the
velocity, \f$ {\cal U} \f$, length, \f$ {\cal L} \f$, and time,
\f${\cal T} \f$, that were used to <A HREF="../../driven_cavity/html/index.html#equation">non-dimensionalise the Navier--Stokes equations</A>, we scale the dimensional quantities such that
\f[
u_i^* = {\cal U} \, u_i, \qquad
R_i^* = {\cal L} \, R_i, \qquad
t^* = {\cal T} \, t.
\f]
The non-dimensional form of the kinematic boundary condition is then
given by
\f[
\left(u_i - St\, \frac{\partial R_i}{\partial t}\right) n_i = 0,
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[eqn:theory_kinematicBC]@
\f]
where the Strouhal number is
\f[
St = \frac{{\cal L}}{{\cal U}{\cal T}}.
\f]

\subsection dynamic_condition_theory The dynamic condition

@I w 0.6\textwidth free_surface_sketch "Sketch of the interface between two fluids. "

The dynamic boundary condition requires the stress to be continuous
across a flat interface between two fluids. Referring to the sketch
above, we define the lower fluid to be fluid 1 and the upper fluid to
be fluid 2. The traction exerted by fluid 1 onto fluid 2, \f$
\mathbf{t}^{[1]*} \f$, is equal and opposite to that exerted by fluid
2 onto fluid 1, \f$ \mathbf{t}^{[2]*} \f$, and therefore \f$
\mathbf{t}^{[1]*} = - \mathbf{t}^{[2]*} \f$. The traction in fluid \f$
\beta \f$ (\f$ \beta = 1,2 \f$) is given by
\f[
t_i^{[\beta]*} = \tau_{ij}^{[\beta]*} \, n_j^{[\beta]},
\f]
where \f$ \mathbf{\tau}^{[\beta]*} \f$ is the stress tensor in fluid \f$
\beta \f$ and \f$ \mathbf{n}^{[\beta]} \f$ is the outer unit normal to
fluid \f$ \beta \f$. Since \f$ \mathbf{n}^{[2]} \f$ must equal \f$
-\mathbf{n}^{[1]} \f$, we have
\f[
\tau_{ij}^{[1]*} \, n_j^{[1]} = \tau_{ij}^{[2]*} \, n_j^{[1]},
\f]
where we have arbitrarily chosen to use \f$ \mathbf{n}^{[1]} \f$ as
the unit normal.

On curved surfaces, surface tension creates a pressure jump \f$ \Delta p^*
= \sigma \kappa^* \f$ across the interface, where \f$ \sigma \f$ is the
surface tension and \f$ \kappa^* \f$ is equal to twice the mean curvature of
the surface. Therefore the dynamic boundary condition is given by
\f[
\tau_{ij}^{[2]*} \, n_j^{[1]} =
\tau_{ij}^{[1]*} \, n_j^{[1]} + \sigma \, \kappa^* \, n_i^{[1]},
\f]
where \f$ \kappa > 0 \f$ if the centre of curvature lies inside fluid
1. Using the same problem-specific reference quantities as in the
<A HREF="#kinematic_condition_theory">section above</A>, the
dimensional quantities are scaled such that
\f[
\tau_{ij}^* = \frac{\mu_{ref} \, {\cal U}}{{\cal L}} \, \tau_{ij}, \qquad
\kappa^* = \frac{1}{{\cal L}} \, \kappa.
\f]
The non-dimensional form of the dynamic boundary condition is then
given by
\f[
\tau_{ij}^{[2]} \, n_j^{[1]} =
\tau_{ij}^{[1]} \, n_j^{[1]} + \frac{1}{Ca} \, \kappa \, n_i^{[1]},
\f]
where the Capillary number is
\f[
Ca = \frac{\mu_{ref} \, {\cal U}}{\sigma}.
\f]

In certain cases, such as the example problem below, we wish to model
the fluid above the interface as totally inviscid. In this case, the
stress tensor in fluid 2 reduces to \f$ \tau_{ij}^{[2]} = -
\delta_{ij} p_{ext} \f$, where \f$ p_{ext} \f$ is the
(non-dimensional) constant pressure above the free surface. The
dynamic boundary condition therefore becomes
\f[
\tau_{ij} \, n_j = - \left( \frac{1}{Ca} \, \kappa + p_{ext} \right) n_i,
\f]
where we have dropped the explicit references to fluid 1 since it is
understood that the stress tensor and unit normals refer to those of
the (one and only) viscous fluid in the problem.

We shall now discuss how the free surface boundary conditions are
implemented in \c oomph-lib.

\section implementation Implementation

\subsection kinematic_condition_implementation The kinematic condition and the pseudo-solid node-update procedure

In addition to solving for the fluid velocity and pressure (as in all
Navier--Stokes examples), we have additional degrees of freedom in our
problem due to the fact that the position of the free surface \f$
\mathbf{R} \f$ is unknown. The Navier--Stokes elements in
\c oomph-lib are based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) form
of the Navier-Stokes equations, and so can be used to solve problems
in moving domains. This allows us to discretise our domain using a
boundary fitted mesh, which will need to deform in response to 
the motion of the free surface. This is achieved by treating the
interior of the mesh as a fictitious elastic solid, and solving a
solid mechanics problem for the (unknown) nodal positions. This
technique, which will subsequently be referred to as a `pseudo-solid
node-update strategy', employs wrapper elements to
existing fluid and solid equation classes. The specific element used
in this example is a \c PseudoSolidNodeUpdateElement<QCrouzeixRaviartElement<2>, \c QPVDElement<2,3> \c >
element, which takes two template arguments. The first is the standard
element type used to solve the fluid problem, and the second is the
element type which solves the equations that are used to control the
mesh deformation.

The deformation of the free surface boundary is imposed by introducing
a field of Lagrange multipliers at the free surface, following the
method outlined in Cairncross et al., `A finite element method for
free surface flows of incompressible fluids in three dimensions. Part
I. Boundary fitted mesh motion' (2000). These new unknowns are stored
as nodal values, and so the vector of values at each node is resized
accordingly. Since this introduces further degrees of freedom into the
problem, we require an additional equation: the kinematic boundary
condition (@R[eqn:theory_kinematicBC]@).

We discretise this equation by attaching \c FaceElements to the
boundaries of the "bulk" elements that are adjacent to the free
surface. The specific \c FaceElement used in this example is an \c
ElasticLineFluidInterfaceElement<ELEMENT>, which takes the bulk
element type as a template argument. This allows the user of the driver
code to easily change the bulk element type, since the appropriate
\c FaceElement type is automatically used. These \c FaceElements
are applied in the same way as all other surface 
elements (e.g. \c NavierStokesTractionElements, \c UnsteadyHeatFluxElements,
etc.), and a general introduction can be found in <A HREF="../../../poisson/two_d_poisson_flux_bc/html/index.html#create_flux">another tutorial</A>.

\subsection dynamic_condition_implementation The dynamic condition

Within a finite element framework, the dynamic boundary condition is
incorporated as contributions to each of the momentum equations at the
free surface. We refer to Ruschak, `A method for incorporating free
boundaries with surface tension in finite element fluid-flow
simulators' (1980), for details on the formulation, which can also be
found in our <a
href="../../surface_theory/html/index.html#boundary_conditions"> free
surface theory </a> document.
Since both Taylor--Hood and Crouzeix--Raviart elements
are implemented such that the normal stresses between elements are
balanced, applying the dynamic boundary condition in cases in
which we are solving the Navier--Stokes equations on both sides of the
interface is as straightforward as adding the appropriate surface
tension contributions to the relevant momentum equations at the
interface. In cases such as the example below, where we have an
inviscid fluid above
the free surface, we need to add the appropriate external pressure
contributions (if any) as well. Both of these contributions are
automatically added to the appropriate momentum equations using
the same \c FaceElements which are used to discretise the kinematic
boundary condition (see <A HREF="#kinematic_condition_implementation">above</A>).

The Capillary number defaults to 1.0 and other values may be set using
the function:

\code
double* FluidInterfaceElement::ca_pt().
\endcode

The Strouhal number defaults to 1.0 and other values may be set using
the function:

\code
double* FluidInterfaceElement::st_pt().
\endcode

The external pressure defaults to zero and other values may be set
using the function:

\code
void FluidInterfaceElement::set_external_pressure_data(Data* p_ext_data_pt),
\endcode

where \c p_ext_data_pt is (a pointer to) the \c Data in which the
value of the external pressure is stored. We note that the external
pressure is represented by \c Data because it may be an unknown in
certain problems, although it is simply a constant parameter in the
example below. It can be accessed using the function:

\code
double FluidInterfaceElement::pext().
\endcode

The way in which the dynamic condition is incorporated within our
finite element structure is discussed in more detail in the 
<A HREF="#application_of_dbc">comments</A> at the end of this tutorial.

with superimposed streamlines, taken from <A HREF="../figures/single_layer.avi">an animation of the flow field</A>,

At time \f$ t \leq 0 \f$ the free surface is fixed in its deformed shape,
but as the simulation begins the restoring forces of surface tension
and gravitational acceleration act to revert it to its undeformed flat
state. The surface oscillates up and down, but the 
motion is damped as the energy in the system is dissipated through
viscous forces. Eventually the interface settles down to its
equilibrium position. This viscous damping effect can be seen in the
following time-trace of the height of the fluid layer at the edge of
the domain.

\section validation Validation

The free surface boundary conditions for the Cartesian Navier--Stokes
equations have been validated against an analytical test case, and we
present the results in the figure below. For sufficiently small
amplitudes, \f$ \epsilon \ll 1 \f$, we can linearise the governing
equations by proposing that we can write the fluid velocities and
pressure, \f$ u(x,y,t) \f$, \f$ v(x,y,t) \f$ and \f$ p(x,y,t) \f$, as
well as the `height' of the interface, \f$ h(x,t) \f$, in the form \f$
x = \bar{x} + \epsilon \hat{x} \f$, where the barred quantities
correspond to the `base' state, chosen here to be the trivial solution \f$
\bar{h} = \bar{u} = \bar{v} = \bar{p} = 0 \f$. Once the linearised
forms of the governing equations and boundary conditions have been
determined we propose a seperable solution of the form
\f[
\hat{h}(x,t) = H e^{\lambda t + ikx},
\f]
\f[
\hat{u}(x,y,t) = U(y) e^{\lambda t + ikx},
\f]
\f[
\hat{v}(x,y,t) = V(y) e^{\lambda t + ikx},
\f]
and
\f[
\hat{p}(x,y,t) = P(y) e^{\lambda t + ikx}.
\f]
Substituting the above ansatz into the governing equations results in
a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for \f$ U(y) \f$,
\f$ V(y) \f$ and \f$ P(y) \f$ which we solve to find their general
solutions up to a set of unknown constants \f$ A \f$, \f$ B \f$, \f$ C
\f$ and \f$ D \f$. By substituting these general forms into the set of
(linearised and seperated) boundary conditions we obtain a linear
system of five equations in the five unknowns \f$ A \f$, \f$ B \f$,
\f$ C \f$, \f$ D \f$ and \f$ H \f$, from which we can assemble a
homogeneous linear system of the form
\f[
  \mathbf{M} \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      A \\  B \\  C \\  D \\ H
    \end{array}
  \right] = \left[
    \begin{array}{c}
      0 \\  0 \\  0 \\  0 \\ 0
    \end{array}
  \right],
\f]
where \f$ \mathbf{M} \f$ is a \f$ 5 \times 5 \f$ matrix whose entries
are the coefficients of the unknowns in our five conditions. This
system only has a non-trivial solution if \f$ \left| \mathbf{M}
\right| = 0 \f$, and solving this equation gives us \f$ \lambda \f$ as a
function of \f$ k \f$. This is a dispersion relation and describes how wave
propagation varies as a function of its wavenumber. More specifically,
the real part of \f$ \lambda \f$ is the growth rate of the wave and the
imaginary part is its frequency. This analytical result can now be
compared to numerical results computed for given values of the
wavenumber \f$ k \f$. We choose an initial deflection amplitude of \f$
\epsilon = 0.01 \f$ and determine the growth rate and frequency of the
oscillation from a time-trace of the left-hand edge of the interface.

\section namespace Global parameters and functions

As usual, we use a namespace to define the dimensionless parameters
\f$ Re \f$, \f$ St \f$, \f$ Re/Fr \f$ and \f$ Ca \f$, and we
create a vector \f$ G \f$ which will define the direction in which
gravity acts. We will need to pass the Strouhal number to the
interface elements, but the product of the Strouhal number and the
Reynolds number to the bulk elements. To avoid potentially
inconsistent parameters, we compute \f$ Re \, St \f$ rather than
defining it explicitly. Because the mesh is to be updated using a
pseudo-solid node-update strategy, we also require the Poisson ratio
for the generalised Hookean constitutive law.

\dontinclude elastic_single_layer.cc
\skipline start_of_namespace
\until End of namespace

<HR>
<HR>

\section main The driver code

We start by computing the product of the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers
before specifying the (non-dimensional) length of time for which
we want the simulation to run and the size of the timestep. Because all driver
codes are run as part of \c oomph-lib's self-testing routines we allow
the user to pass a command line argument to the executable which sets
the maximum time to some lower value.

\skipline start_of_main
\until t_max = 0.005

Next we specify the dimensions of the mesh and the number of elements
in the \f$ x_1 \f$ and \f$ x_2 \f$ directions. To remain consistent
with the example code we shall from now on refer to \f$ x_1 \f$ as \f$
x \f$ and \f$ x_2 \f$ as \f$ y \f$.

\skipline Number of elements in x direction
\until double h

At this point we define the direction in which gravity acts:
vertically downwards.

\skipline Set direction of gravity
\until G[1]

Finally, we build the problem using the `pseudo-solid' version of \c
QCrouzeixRaviartElements and the \c BDF<2> timestepper, before calling \c
unsteady_run(...). This function solves the system at each timestep
using the \c Problem::unsteady_newton_solve(...) function before
documenting the result.

\skipline Set up the elastic test problem
\until End of main

<HR>
<HR>

\section problem_class The problem class

Since we are solving the unsteady Navier--Stokes equations, the
\c Problem class is very similar to that used in the <A HREF="../../rayleigh_channel/html/index.html">Rayleigh
channel example</A>. We specify the type of the element and the type
of the timestepper (assumed to be a member of the \c BDF family) as
template parameters, before passing the number of elements and domain
length in both coordinate directions to the problem constructor. We
define an empty destructor, functions to set the initial and boundary
conditions and a post-processing function \c doc_solution(...),
which will be used by the timestepping function \c unsteady_run(...).

\dontinclude elastic_single_layer.cc
\skipline start_of_problem_class
\until unsteady_run

The nodal positions are unknowns in the problem and hence are updated
automatically, so there is no need to update the mesh before
performing a Newton solve. However, since the main use of the
methodology demonstrated here is in
free-boundary problems where the solution of the solid problem merely
serves to update the nodal positions in response to the motion of the
free surface, we reset the nodes' Lagrangian coordinates to their
Eulerian positions before every solve, by calling \c
SolidMesh::set_lagrangian_nodal_coordinates(). This makes the deformed
configuration stress-free and tends to stabilise the computation,
allowing larger domain deformations to be computed.

\skipline private
\until deform_free_surface

The problem class stores pointers to the specific bulk mesh and the
surface mesh, which will contain the interface elements, as well as
a pointer to a constitutive law for the pseudo-solid mesh. The width
of the domain is also stored since it is used by the function \c
deform_free_surface(...) when setting up the initial mesh
deformation. Finally we store an output stream in which we record the
height of the interface at the domain edge.

\skipline Pointer to the (specific) "bulk" mesh
\until End of problem class

<HR>
<HR>

\section constructor The problem constructor

The constructor starts by copying the width of the domain into the
private member data of the problem class, before building the
timestepper.

\skipline start_of_constructor
\until add_time_stepper_pt

Next we build the bulk mesh. The mesh we are using is the \c
ElasticRectangularQuadMesh<ELEMENT>, which takes the bulk element as
a template argument. The boolean argument in the mesh constructor,
which is set to `true' here, indicates whether or not the domain is to
be periodic in \f$ x \f$. The surface mesh is also built, although it
is empty at this point.

\skipline Build and assign the "bulk" mesh
\until Surface_mesh_pt

Having created the bulk elements, we now create the interface
elements. We first build an empty mesh in which to store them, before
looping over the bulk elements adjacent to the free surface and
`attaching' interface elements to their upper faces. These
newly-created elements are then stored in the surface mesh.

\skipline ------------
\until }

Now that the interface elements have been created, we combine the bulk
and surface meshes into a single mesh.

\skipline Add the two sub-meshes to the problem
\until build_global_mesh

On the solid bottom boundary (\f$ y = 0 \f$) we pin both velocity
components so that there is no penetration of the wall by the fluid
or flow along it. On the left and right symmetry boundaries (\f$ x =
0.0 \f$ and \f$ x = 1.0 \f$) we pin the \f$ x \f$ component of the
velocity but leave the \f$ y \f$ component unconstrained. We do not
apply any velocity boundary conditions to the free surface (the top
boundary). We pin the vertical displacement of the nodes on the bottom
boundary (since these must remain stationary) and pin the horizontal
displacement of all nodes in the mesh.

\skipline -----
\until Bulk_mesh_pt->node_pt(n)->pin_position(0)

Next we create a generalised Hookean constitutive equation for the
pseudo-solid mesh. This constitutive equation is discussed in <A HREF="../../../solid/disk_compression/html/index.html#hooke">another tutorial</A>.

\skipline Define a constitutive law
\until GeneralisedHookean

We loop over the bulk elements and pass them pointers to the Reynolds
and Womersley numbers, \f$ Re \f$ and \f$ Re\, St \f$, the product of
the Reynolds number and the inverse of the Froude number, \f$ Re/Fr
\f$, the direction of gravity, \f$ G \f$, and the constitutive law. In
addition we pass a pointer to the global time object, created when we
called \c Problem::add_time_stepper_pt(...) above.

\skipline -----
\until End of loop over bulk elements

Next we create a pointer to a \c Data value for the external pressure
\f$ p_{ext} \f$, before pinning it and assigning an arbitrary
value.

\skipline Create a Data object
\until set_value

We then loop over the interface elements and pass them a pointer to this
external pressure value as well as pointers to the Strouhal and
Capillary numbers.

\skipline Determine number of 1D interface elements
\until End of loop over interface elements

Finally, we apply the problem's boundary conditions (discussed <A HREF="#set_boundary_conditions">later on</A>) before setting up the equation
numbering scheme using the function \c Problem::assign_eqn_numbers().

\skipline Apply the boundary conditions
\until End of constructor

<HR>
<HR>

\section set_initial_condition Initial conditions

This function sets the initial conditions for the problem. We loop
over all nodes in the mesh and set both velocity components to
zero. No initial conditions are required for the pressure. We then
call the function \c Problem::assign_initial_values_impulsive() which
copies the current values at each of the nodes, as well as the current
nodal positions, into the required number of history values
for the timestepper in question. This corresponds to an impulsive
start, as for all time \f$ t \leq 0 \f$ none of the fluid is moving
and the shape of the interface is constant.

\skipline start_of_set_initial_condition
\until End of set_initial_condition

<HR>
<HR>

\section set_boundary_conditions Boundary conditions

This function sets the boundary conditions for the problem. Since the
Dirichlet conditions are homogeneous this function is not strictly
necessary as all values are initialised to zero by default.

\skipline start_of_set_boundary_conditions
\until End of set_boundary_conditions

<HR>
<HR>

\section deform_free_surface Prescribing the initial free surface position

At the beginning of the simulation the free surface is deformed by a
prescribed function (@R[eqn:freesurfacedeformation]@). To do this we
define a function, \c deform_free_surface(...), which cycles through
the bulk mesh's \c Nodes and modifies their positions
accordingly, such that the nodes on the free surface follow the
prescribed interface shape (@R[eqn:freesurfacedeformation]@) and the
bulk nodes retain their fractional position between the lower and the
(now deformed) upper boundary.

\skipline start_of_deform_free_surface
\until End of deform_free_surface

<HR>
<HR>

\section doc Post-processing

As expected, this member function documents the computed
solution. We first output the value of the current time to the screen,
before recording the continuous time and the height of the free
surface at the domain boundary in the trace file. We note that as the
domain is periodic the height of the free surface must be the same at
both the left and right boundaries.

\skipline start_of_doc_solution
\until el_pt->node_pt(0)->x(1)

We then output the computed solution.

\skipline ofstream
\until some_file.close()

Finally, we output the shape of the interface.

\skipline Open interface solution output file
\until End of doc_solution

<HR>
<HR>

\section unsteady_run The timestepping loop

The function \c unsteady_run(...) is used to perform the timestepping
procedure. We start by deforming the free surface in the manner
specified by equation (@R[eqn:freesurfacedeformation]@).

\skipline start_of_unsteady_run
\until deform_free_surface

We then create a \c DocInfo object to store the output directory and
the label for the output files.

\skipline Initialise DocInfo object
\until doc_info.number()=0

Next we open and initialise the trace file.

\skipline Open trace file
\until std::endl

Before using any of \c oomph-lib's timestepping functions, the timestep
\f$ dt \f$ must be passed to the problem's timestepping routines by calling
the function \c Problem::initialise_dt(...) which sets the weights for
all timesteppers in the problem. Next we assign the initial conditions
by calling \c Problem::set_initial_condition(), which was discussed
<A HREF="#set_initial_condition">above</A>.

\skipline Initialise timestep
\until set_initial_condition

We determine the number of timesteps to be performed and document the
initial conditions, and then perform the actual timestepping loop. For
each timestep the function \c unsteady_newton_solve(dt) is called and
the solution documented.

\skipline Determine number of timesteps
\until End of unsteady_run

\subsection application_of_dbc The application of the dynamic boundary condition within the FEM

As discussed in an <A HREF="../../rayleigh_traction_channel/html/index.html#traction_theory">earlier tutorial</A>, 
the finite element solution of the Navier--Stokes equations is based
on their weak form, which is obtained by weighting the
stress-divergence form of the momentum equations with the global test
functions \f$ \psi_l \f$, and integrating by parts to obtain the
discrete residuals
\f[
f_{il} = 
\int_D \left[
Re\left(St\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + 
u_j\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} - \frac{G_i}{Fr}\right)  \ \psi_l +
 \tau_{ij} \ \frac{\partial \psi_l}{\partial x_j}   \right] \, dV -
\int_{\partial D}  \tau_{ij} \ n_j \ \psi_l \ dS = 0.
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[Weak2DNavierStokes_Stress]@
\f]
Weighting the dynamic condition (@R[eqn:dynamicBC]@) by the same
global test functions \f$ \psi_l \f$ and integrating over the domain
boundary \f$ \partial D\f$ gives
\f[
\int_{\partial D} \tau_{ij} n_j \ \psi_l \ dS =
- \int_{\partial D} p_{ext} n_i \ \psi_l \ dS
- \int_{\partial D} \frac{1}{Ca} \kappa \ \psi_l \ dS.
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[weak_dynamic_bc1]@
\f]
In a two-dimensional problem, such as the one considered in this
tutorial, the domain boundary reduces to a one-dimensional curve, \f$
C \f$. A further integration by parts of (@R[weak_dynamic_bc1]@)
therefore gives
\f[
\int_{\partial D} \tau_{ij} n_j \ \psi_l \ dS =
- \int_C p_{ext} n_i \ \psi_l \ dS
+ \int_C \frac{1}{Ca} t_i \ \frac{\partial\psi_l}{\partial S} \ dS
- \frac{1}{Ca} \left[ t_i \ \psi_l \right]^{c_2}_{c_1},
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[weak_dynamic_bc2]@
\f]
where \f$ t_i \f$, \f$ (i=1,2) \f$ is the \f$ i \f$-th component of a
unit vector tangent to \f$ C \f$ and pointing in the direction of
increasing \f$ S \f$, and \f$ c_1 \f$ and \f$ c_2 \f$ are the two
endpoints of \f$ C \f$.

In the problem considered in this tutorial, the domain boundary \f$ C
\f$ can be written as \f$ C = C_{solid} \ \cup \ C_{surface} \f$, where
\f$ C_{solid} \f$ represents the portion of the domain boundary
corresponding to a rigid wall and \f$ C_{surface} \f$ represents the
portion corresponding to the free surface. The velocity along \f$
C_{solid} \f$ is prescribed by Dirichlet boundary conditions, and we <A HREF="../../../intro/html/index.html#galerkin">recall</A> 
that the global test functions \f$ \psi_l \f$ vanish in this case. On
non-Dirichlet boundaries we must either specify the external pressure \f$
p_{ext} \f$, or deliberately neglect this term to obtain the `natural'
condition \f$ p_{ext} = 0 \f$.

\subsection contact_line The contact line

In this two-dimensional case, the contact `line' actually reduces to
two contact points, \f$ c_1 \f$ and \f$ c_2 \f$, which are located at
either side of the portion of the domain boundary corresponding to the
free surface \f$ C_{surface} \f$. The two point contributions are
added by specifying the the tangent to the surface \f$ t_i \f$ at
each of the contact points, which is equivalent to prescribing the
contact angle that the free surface makes with the 
neighbouring domain boundary. We note that in the problem considered
here we do not explicitly apply any boundary conditions at either end
of the free surface. Neglecting these contributions corresponds to the
`natural' condition of prescribing a \f$ 90^o \f$ contact angle, which
happens to be the appropriate condition in this case. Contact angles
of arbitrary size can be enforced using \c FluidInterfaceBoundingElements,
which are discussed in a <A HREF="../../static_single_layer/html/index.html#contact_angle">later tutorial</A>.

Specifying the contact angle is not the only condition that can be
applied at the edges of an interface. The alternative boundary 
condition is to pin the contact line so that its position is fixed
for all time. Since this is a Dirichlet condition it causes the
integral over the contact line to vanish.
