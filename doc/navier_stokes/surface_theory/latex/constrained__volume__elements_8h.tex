\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1VolumeConstraintElement}{oomph\+::\+Volume\+Constraint\+Element}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A class that is used to implement the constraint that the fluid volume in a region bounded by associated Face\+Elements (attached, e.\+g., to the mesh boundaries that enclose a bubble) must take a specific value. This Generalised\+Element is used only to store the desired volume and a pointer to the (usually pressure) freedom that must be traded for the volume constraint. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1VolumeConstraintBoundingElement}{oomph\+::\+Volume\+Constraint\+Bounding\+Element}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Base class for interface elements that allow the application of a volume constraint on the region bounded by these elements. The elements must be used together with the associated \doxylink{classoomph_1_1VolumeConstraintElement}{Volume\+Constraint\+Element} which stores the value of the target volume. Common functionality is provided in this base for storing the external "{}pressure"{} value that is traded for the volume constraint. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1LineVolumeConstraintBoundingElement}{oomph\+::\+Line\+Volume\+Constraint\+Bounding\+Element}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em One-\/dimensional interface elements that allow the application of a volume constraint on the region bounded by these elements. The volume is computed by integrating x.\+n around the boundary of the domain and then dividing by two. The sign is chosen so that the volume will be positive when the elements surround a fluid domain. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1ElasticLineVolumeConstraintBoundingElement}{oomph\+::\+Elastic\+Line\+Volume\+Constraint\+Bounding\+Element$<$ ELEMENT $>$}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The one-\/dimensional interface elements that allow imposition of a volume constraint specialised for the case when the nodal positions of the bulk elements are treated as solid degrees of freedom. To enforce that a fluid volume has a certain volume, attach these elements to all faces of the (2D cartesian) bulk fluid elements (of type ELEMENT) that bound that region and then specify the "{}pressure"{} value that is traded for the constraint. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1SpineLineVolumeConstraintBoundingElement}{oomph\+::\+Spine\+Line\+Volume\+Constraint\+Bounding\+Element$<$ ELEMENT $>$}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The one-\/dimensional interface elements that allow imposition of a volume constraint specialised for the case when the nodal positions of the bulk elements are adjusted using Spines. To enforce that a fluid volume has a certain volume, attach these elements to all faces of the (2D cartesian) bulk fluid elements (of type ELEMENT) that bound that region and then specify the "{}pressure"{} value that is traded for the constraint. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Axisymmetric (one-\/dimensional) interface elements that allow the application of a volume constraint on the region bounded by these elements. The volume is computed by integrating x.\+n around the boundary of the domain and then dividing by three. The sign is chosen so that the volume will be positive when the elements surround a fluid domain. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
