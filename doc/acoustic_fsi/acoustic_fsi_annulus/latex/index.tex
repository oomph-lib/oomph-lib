In this document we discuss the solution of time-\/harmonic acoustic fluid-\/structure interaction problems. We start by reviewing the relevant theory and then present the solution of a simple model problem -- the sound radiation from an oscillating circular cylinder that is coated with a compressible elastic layer.

This problem combines the problems discussed in the tutorials illustrating

The figure below shows a sketch of a representative model problem\+: a circular cylinder is immersed in an inviscid compressible fluid and performs a prescribed two-\/dimensional harmonic oscillation of radian frequency $\omega$. The cylinder is coated with a compressible elastic layer. We wish to compute the displacement field in the elastic coating (assumed to be described by the \href{../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html}{\texttt{ equations of time-\/harmonic linear elasticity}}) and the pressure distribution in the fluid (governed by \href{../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html}{\texttt{ the Helmholtz equation}}). The two sets of equations interact at the interface between fluid and solid\+: the fluid pressure exerts a traction onto the elastic layer, while the motion of the elastic layer drives the fluid motion via the non-\/penetration condition.

\hypertarget{index_fluid}{}\doxysubsection{The fluid model\+: the Helmholtz equation}\label{index_fluid}
We describe the behaviour of the fluid in terms of the displacement field, $ d_i^*(x_j^*,t^*)$, of the fluid particles. As usual we employ index notation and the summation convention, and use asterisks to distinguish dimensional quantities from their non-\/dimensional equivalents. The fluid is inviscid and compressible, with a bulk modulus $ B $, such that the acoustic pressure is given by $ P^* = - B \ \partial d_j^*/\partial x_j^* $ We assume that the fluid motion is irrotational and can be described by a displacement potential $\Phi^*$, such that $ d^*_j = \partial \Phi^*/\partial x_j^*. $ We consider steady-\/state time-\/harmonic oscillations and write the displacement potential and the pressure as $\Phi^*(x_j^*,t^*) = \mbox{Re} \{\phi^*(x_j^*) \exp(-{\rm i} \omega t^*)\} $ and $P^*(x_j^*,t^*) = \mbox{Re}\{p^*(x_j^*) \exp(-{\rm i} \omega t^*)\}$, respectively, where $\mbox{Re}\{\ldots \}$ denotes the real part. For small disturbances, the linearised Euler equation reveals that the time-\/harmonic pressure is related to the displacement potential via $ p^* = \rho_{\rm f} \omega^2 \phi^*$ where $ \rho_{\rm f} $ is the ambient fluid density. We non-\/dimensionalise all lengths on a problem-\/specific lengthscale $ {\cal L}$ (e.\+g. the outer radius of the coating layer) such that $x_j^* = {\cal L} x_j,\ d_j^* = {\cal L} d_j$ and $\phi^* = {\cal L}^2 \phi$. The non-\/dimensional displacement potential $\phi$ is then governed by the Helmholtz equation \[ \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x_j^{2}} + k^2 \phi = 0, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1) \] where the square of the non-\/dimensional wavenumber, \[ k^2 = \frac{\rho_f (\omega {\cal L})^2}{B}, \] represents the ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the `stiffness' of the fluid.\hypertarget{index_elastic}{}\doxysubsection{The solid model\+: the time harmonic equations of linear elasticity}\label{index_elastic}
We model the coating layer as a linearly elastic solid, described in terms of a displacement field $U^*_i(x_j^*,t^*)$, with stress tensor \[ \tau_{ij}^* = E \left[ \frac{\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)} \, \frac{\partial U_k^*}{\partial x_k^*} \, \delta_{ij} +\frac{1}{2(1+\nu)}\left( \frac{\partial U_i^*}{\partial x_j^*}+ \frac{\partial U_j^*}{\partial x_i^*} \right) \right], \] where $E$ and $\nu$ are the material\textquotesingle{}s Young\textquotesingle{}s modulus and Poisson\textquotesingle{}s ratio, respectively. As before, we assume a time-\/harmonic solution with frequency $\omega$ so that $U_i^*(x_j^*,t^*) = {\rm Re} \{ u_i^*(x_j^*) \exp(-{\rm i}\omega t^*)\}$, and we non-\/dimensionalise the displacements on ${\cal L}$ and the stress on Young\textquotesingle{}s modulus, $E$, so that $u_j^* = {\cal L} u_j$ and $\tau_{ij}^* = E \tau_{ij}$. The deformation of the elastic coating is then governed by the time-\/harmonic Navier-\/\+Lame equations \[ \frac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_j} + \Omega^2 u_i = 0, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2) \] which depend (implicitly) on Poisson\textquotesingle{}s ratio $\nu$, and on the (square of the) non-\/dimensional wavenumber \[ \Omega^2 = \frac{\rho_{\rm s} (\omega {\cal L})^2}{E}, \] where $ \rho_{\rm s} $ is the solid density. The parameter $ \Omega^2 $ represents the ratio of the typical inertial solid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. We note that for a `light' coating we have $\Omega \ll 1$.\hypertarget{index_bc}{}\doxysubsection{Boundary conditions}\label{index_bc}
The inner surface of the elastic coating, $ \partial D_{\rm s} $, is subject to the prescribed displacement imposed by the oscillating cylinder. For instance, if the inner cylinder performs axisymmetric oscillations of non-\/dimensional amplitude $ \epsilon$, we have \[ \mbox{\bf u} = \epsilon \, \mbox{\bf e}_r \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm s}$}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3) \] where $ \mbox{\bf e}_r $ is the unit vector in the radial direction. The fluid-\/loaded surface of the elastic coating, $ \partial D_{\rm f} $, is subject to the fluid pressure. The non-\/dimensional traction exerted by the fluid onto the solid (on the solid stress scale) is therefore given by \[ t_i^{\rm [solid]} = \tau_{ij}^{\rm [solid]} n_j = - \phi \ Q \ n_i \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm f}$}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (4) \] where the $n_i$ are the components of the outer unit normal on the solid boundary $\partial D_{\rm f}$ and \[ Q=\frac{\rho_{\rm f}({\cal L}\omega)^2}{E} \] is the final non-\/dimensional parameter in the problem. It represents the ratio of the typical inertial fluid pressure induced by the wall oscillation to the stiffness of the elastic coating. The parameter $Q$ therefore provides a measure of the strength of the fluid-\/structure interaction (FSI) in the sense that for $Q \to 0$ the elastic coating does not `feel' the presence of the fluid.

The fluid is forced by the normal displacement of the solid. Imposing the non-\/penetration condition $(d_j - u_j) n_j = 0$ on $\partial D_{\rm f}$ yields a Neumann condition for the displacement potential, \[ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = u_j n_j \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm f}$}. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (5) \] Finally, the displacement potential for the fluid must satisfy the Sommerfeld radiation condition \[ \lim_{r \to \infty} \sqrt{r}\left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial r} - {\rm i} k \phi \right) = 0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (6) \] which ensures that the oscillating cylinder does not generate any incoming waves.

\hypertarget{index_impl}{}\doxysection{Implementation}\label{index_impl}
The implementation of the coupled problem follows the usual procedure for multi-\/domain problems in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}. We discretise the constituent single-\/physics problems using the existing single-\/physics elements, here {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html}{\texttt{ Helmholtz elements}}
\end{DoxyItemize}and
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html}{\texttt{ time-\/harmonic linear elasticity elements}}
\end{DoxyItemize}for the discretisation of the PDEs (1) and (2), respectively. The displacement boundary condition (3) on the inner surface of the elastic coating is imposed as usual by pinning the relevant degrees of freedom, exactly as in a \href{../../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html}{\texttt{ single-\/physics solid mechanics problem}}. Similarly, the Sommerfeld radiation condition (6) on the outer boundary of the fluid domain can be imposed by any of the methods available for the solution of the single-\/physics Helmholtz equation, such as \href{../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html\#ABCs}{\texttt{ approximate/absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs)}} or a \href{../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html\#DtN}{\texttt{ Dirichlet-\/to-\/\+Neumann mapping.}}

The boundary conditions (4) and (5) at the fluid-\/solid interface are traction boundary conditions for the solid, and Neumann boundary conditions for the Helmholtz equation, respectively. In a single-\/physics problem we would impose such boundary conditions by attaching suitable {\ttfamily Face\+Elements} to the appropriate boundaries of the \char`\"{}bulk\char`\"{} elements, as shown in the sketch below\+: {\ttfamily Time\+Harmonic\+Linear\+Elasticity\+Traction\+Elements} could be used to impose a (given) traction, $ {\bf t}_0$, onto the solid; {\ttfamily Helmholtz\+Flux\+Elements} could be used to impose a (given) normal derivative, $ f_0$, on the displacement potential. Both $ {\bf t}_0$ and $ f_0 $ would usually be specified in a user-\/defined namespace and accessed via function pointers as indicated in the right half of the sketch.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{single_physics}
\doxyfigcaption{Sketch illustrating the imposition of flux and traction boundary conditions in single-\/physics problems. The continuous problems are shown on the left; the discretised ones on the right. }
\end{DoxyImage}


In the coupled problem, illustrated in the left half of the next sketch, the traction acting on the solid becomes a function of the displacement potential via the boundary condition (4), while the normal derivative of the displacement potential is given in terms of the solid displacement via equation (5). Note that corresponding points on the FSI boundary $ \partial D_{\rm f}$ are identified by matching values of the boundary coordinate $ \zeta $ which is assumed to be consistent between the two domains.

The implementation of this interaction in the discretised problem is illustrated in the right half of the sketch\+: We replace the single-\/physics {\ttfamily Helmholtz\+Flux\+Elements} by {\ttfamily Helmholtz\+Flux\+From\+Normal\+Displacement\+BCElements}, and the {\ttfamily Time\+Harmonic\+Linear\+Elasticity\+Traction\+Elements} by {\ttfamily Time\+Harmonic\+Lin\+Elast\+Loaded\+By\+Helmholtz\+Pressure\+BCElements}. (Yes, we like to be verbose...). Both of these {\ttfamily Face\+Elements} are derived from the {\ttfamily Element\+With\+External\+Element} base class and can therefore store a pointer to an \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} element that provides the information required to impose the appropriate boundary condition. Thus, the {\ttfamily Helmholtz\+Flux\+From\+Normal\+Displacement\+BCElements} store pointers to the \char`\"{}adjacent\char`\"{} time-\/harmonic linear elasticity elements (from which they obtain the boundary displacement required for the imposition of (5)), while the {\ttfamily Time\+Harmonic\+Lin\+Elast\+Loaded\+By\+Helmholtz\+Pressure\+BCElements} store pointers to the \char`\"{}adjacent\char`\"{} Helmholtz elements that provide the value of the displacement potential required for the evaluation of (4).

\doxyfigcaption{Sketch illustrating the imposition of flux and traction boundary conditions in the coupled multi-\/physics problem. The continuous problems are shown on the left; the discretised ones on the right. }
\end{DoxyImage}


The identification of the \char`\"{}adjacent\char`\"{} bulk elements can be performed using the {\ttfamily Multi\+\_\+domain\+\_\+functions\+::setup\+\_\+bulk\+\_\+elements\+\_\+adjacent\+\_\+to\+\_\+face\+\_\+mesh(...)} helper function. We note that, as suggested by the sketch above, this function does not require to the two adjacent meshes to have a consistent discretisation -- the identification of adjacent elements is based entirely on the (assumed to be consistent) boundary coordinate $ \zeta $ in the two meshes. We refer to \href{../../../poisson/fish_poisson2/html/index.html\#boundary_coords}{\texttt{ another tutorial}} for a discussion of how to set up (or change) the parametrisation of mesh boundaries by boundary coordinates.

The animation below shows the deformation of the elastic coating if a non-\/axisymmetric displacement \[ \mbox{\bf u} = \epsilon \, \mbox{\bf e}_r \cos (N\varphi) \mbox{\ \ \ \ \ on $\partial D_{\rm s}$}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (7) \] (for $ N=3 $) is imposed on the inner boundary of the coating $\partial D_{\rm s}$.

Finally, we provide some validation of the computational results by comparing the non-\/dimensional time-\/average radiated power \[ \overline{\cal P} = \frac{1}{2} \oint\bigg[Im\bigg(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}\bigg) \ Re(\phi) - Re\bigg(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}\bigg) \ Im(\phi) \bigg] \ dS \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (8) \] against the analytical solution for axisymmetric forcing ( $ N=0 $) for the parameter values $ k^2 = 10 $, $ \Omega^2 = 0 $, $ \nu =0.3 $ and a non-\/dimensional coating thickness of $ h = 0.2; $ see \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2012.05.029}{\texttt{ Heil, M., Kharrat, T., Cotterill, P.\+A. \& Abrahams, I.\+D.

 We wish to perform parameter studies in which we vary the FSI parameter $ Q $. To make this physically meaningful, we interpret $ Q =(\rho_{\rm f}({\cal L}\omega)^2)/E $ as a measure of the stiffness of the elastic coating (so that an increase in $ Q $ corresponds to a reduction in the layer\textquotesingle{}s elastic modulus $ E $). In that case, the frequency parameter $ \Omega^2 = (\rho_{\rm s} (\omega {\cal L})^2)/E $ in the time-\/harmonic linear elasticity equations becomes a dependent parameter and is given in terms of the density ratio $ \rho_{\rm solid}/\rho_{\rm fluid} $ and $ Q $ by $ \Omega^2 = (\rho_{\rm solid}/\rho_{\rm fluid}) Q$. We therefore provide a helper function to update the dependent parameter following any change in the independent parameters.

The Helmholtz mesh occupies the region between $ r = 1 $ and $ r=R_{\rm outer} $ where $ R_{\rm outer}$ is the outer radius of the computational domain where we will apply the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Note that the two meshes are not matching -- both meshes have 3 element layers in the radial direction but 10 and 11 in the azimuthal direction, respectively. This is done mainly to illustrate our claim that the multi-\/domain setup functions can operate with non-\/matching meshes.

The mesh adaptation is driven by the error estimates for the bulk elements. The various {\ttfamily Face\+Elements} must therefore be removed from the global mesh before the adaptation takes place. We do this by calling the helper function {\ttfamily delete\+\_\+face\+\_\+elements(...)} (discussed below) for the three face meshes, before rebuilding the Problem\textquotesingle{}s global mesh.

\item This tutorial emerged from an actual research project in which we investigated how efficiently the acoustic power radiated from an oscillating cylinder is reduced when the cylinder is coated with an elastic layer, exactly as in the model problem considered here. The paper then went on to investigate the effect of gaps in the coating and discovered some (rather nice) quasi-\/resonances -- values of the FSI parameter $ Q $ at which the radiated acoustic power increases significantly. Read all about it in this paper\+: ~\newline

\item Equation (8) for the time-\/averaged radiated power shows that $ \overline{\cal P}$ depends on the derivatives of the displacement potential $ \phi $. This implies that the value for $ \overline{\cal P}$ computed from the finite-\/element solution for $ \phi $ is not as accurate as the displacement potential itself. Computing $ \overline{\cal P}$ to a certain tolerance (e.\+g. to \char`\"{}graphical accuracy\char`\"{} as in the plot shown above) therefore tends to require meshes that are much finer than would be required if we were only interested in $ \phi $ itself. ~\newline
~\newline
 Investigate the accuracy of the computational predictions for $ \overline{\cal P}$ by\+: ~\newline
~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item increasing the spatial resolution e.\+g. by using the command line flag {\ttfamily --el\+\_\+multiplier} (which controls the number of elements in the mesh) and suppressing any automatic (un)refinement by setting the maximum number of adaptations to zero using the {\ttfamily --max\+\_\+adapt} command line flag. ~\newline
~\newline

\item reducing the outer radius of the computational domain, using the command line flag {\ttfamily --outer\+\_\+radius}, say. ~\newline
~\newline

\item varying the element type, from the bi-\/linear {\ttfamily Refineable\+QHelmholtz\+Element$<$2,2$>$} to the bi-\/cubic {\ttfamily Refineable\+QHelmholtz\+Element$<$2,4$>$}, say.
\end{DoxyItemize}~\newline

 Which of these approaches gives you the \char`\"{}most accuracy\char`\"{} for a given number of degrees of freedom?
