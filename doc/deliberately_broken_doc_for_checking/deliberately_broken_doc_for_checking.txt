\mainpage IGNORE THIS! Deliberately broken doc page for self-test


Here's a code inclusion that works:

\dontinclude scattering.cc
\skipline start_of_namespace
\until std::complex<double> I(0.0,1.0);  

...and here's one that doesn't because I've deliberately broken the hook:


\dontinclude scattering.cc
\skipline start_of_bla_shite
\until std::complex<double> I(0.0,1.0);  


Here's a link that works

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommerfeld_radiation_condition">
Sommerfeld radiation condition</a>

and here's one that possibly doesn't because of an isolated "<a":

<a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommerfeld_radiation_condition">
Sommerfeld radiation condition</a>

Bla bla bla
