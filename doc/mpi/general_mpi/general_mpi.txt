\mainpage Parallel processing

\c oomph-lib is designed so that,
provided the library is compiled with MPI support, discussed below in 
 \ref basics, many of the
most computationally-expensive phases of a typical computation are 
automatically performed in parallel. 
Examples of "automatically parallelised" tasks include
- The assembly of the Jacobian matrix and the residual vector in
  Newton's method.
- Error estimation.
- The solution of the linear systems within the Newton iteration, and any
  preconditioning operations performed within \c oomph-lib's 
  <a  href="../../../mpi/block_preconditioners/html/index.html">
  block-preconditioning framework</a> which relies heavily on the
  library's 
  <a href="../../../mpi/distributed_linear_algebra_infrastructure/html/index.html">
  distributed linear algebra infrastructure.</a>
.
The only parallel task that requires user intervention is 
the distribution of a problem over multiple processors
so that each processor stores a subset of the elements. 
For
straightforward problems, a single call to  \c Problem::distribute() 
suffices.
Furthermore, the majority of \c oomph-lib's
multi-physics helper functions (<em> e.g.</em> the automatic setup of the
fluid load on solid elements in FSI problems; the determination
of "source elements" in multi-field problems; etc) can be used in
distributed problems. For less-straightforward problems, the user may 
have to intervene in the distribution process and/or be aware of the
consequences of the distribution. Hence, the section \ref domain_decomposition
provides an overview of the underlying design used for problem
distribution within \c oomph-lib. A number of 
<a href="../../../example_code_list/html/index.html#parallel">demo
driver codes for distributed problems</a> are provided and
any additional issues are discussed in the accompanying tutorials.

\section basics Basic parallel usage

\subsection installation How to build/install oomph-lib with MPI support

- To compile \c oomph-lib with MPI support you must specify the configure flag
  \n\n
  \code
  --enable-MPI
  \endcode
  \n
  If you use \c oomph-lib's <code>autogen.sh</code> script to build
  the library you should add this line to the
  <code>config/configure_options/current</code> file.
  You should also ensure that appropriate parallel compilers are specified by 
  the \c CXX, \c CC, \c F77 and \c LD flags. For instance, if you use 
  <a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/">LAM</a>, 
  you should use \c CXX=mpic++, \c CC=mpicc, \c F77=mpif77 and \c LD=mpif77.
  \n\n
- When \c oomph-lib is built with MPI support, the macro \c
  OOMPH_HAS_MPI is defined. It is used to isolate parallel 
  sections of code to ensure that the
  library can be used in serial and parallel: <em> e.g. </em>
  \n\n
  \code

  [...]

  #ifdef OOMPH_HAS_MPI

     std::cout << "This code has been compiled with mpi support \n " 
               << "and is running on " << Communicator_pt->nproc() 
               << " processors. " << std::endl;

  #else

     std::cout << "This code has been compiled without mpi support" 
               << std::endl;

  #endif

  [...]

  \endcode
  \n

\subsection running How to run a driver code in parallel

- MPI <strong> must </strong> be initialised in every driver code 
 that is to be run in  parallel, which means that the 
  commands \c MPI_Helpers::init(...) and \c  MPI_Helpers::finalize()
  must be added to the beginning and end of the \c main(...) function, 
  respectively 
  \n\n
  \code   
  int main(int argc, char **argv)
    { 

      // Initialise oomph-lib's MPI       
      MPI_Helpers::init(argc,argv);     
    

      // Normal "serial" code
      [...]  
 
      
      // Shut down oomph-lib's MPI
      MPI_Helpers::finalize();
    }
  \endcode
  \n  
  Running the code on multiple processors should immediately lead to a
 speedup, although this depends on the specific problem. 
 In most applications, the most computationally-expensive tasks
  are the setup of the Jacobian matrix and the solution of the 
  linear systems. When a driver code is run on multiple processors,
  each processor assembles contributions to the Jacobian matrix from a
  different subset of the elements, dividing the work of the
  assembly between processors. In our experience, 
  the assembly of the Jacobian
  matrix tends to scale very well with the number of processors. 
  The parallel performance of 
  the (third-party) linear solvers available from within \c oomph-lib
  varies greatly and their performance is also strongly dependent on
  the underlying hardware, <em> e.g.</em> the speed of your machine's 
  interconnects, etc.
  \n\n
- The MPI header file \c mpi.h is included in \c oomph-lib's
  generic header, so it is not necessary to include it in the
  driver code. The functions \c MPI_Helpers::init(...) 
  and \c  MPI_Helpers::finalize() call their MPI counterparts,
  \c MPI_Init(...) and \c MPI_Finalize(), which \b must \b not be called
  again.  Note also that the \c main(...) function must take arguments
  which are then passed into the \c MPI_Helpers::init(...) function.
  \n\n
- The command used to run a parallel job depends on your particular
  MPI installation. If you use <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">OpenMPI</a>,
  for example, the executable \c parallel_executable is run on, say, four 
  processors by issuing the command
  \n\n
  \code
  mpirun -np 4 ./parallel_executable
  \endcode
  \n
.

\subsection solvers oomph-lib's parallel linear solvers
- \c oomph-lib's default linear solver is \c SuperLUSolver. This is a
  wrapper to the direct linear solvers from the 
  <A HREF="http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU">SuperLU /
  SuperLU_DIST</A> projects. 
  If \c oomph-lib is built with MPI support and the executable is
  run on multiple processors, \c SuperLU_DIST will be used by default,
  otherwise \c SuperLU is used.
  \n\n
- Of \c oomph-lib's own iterative linear solvers, only \c CG
  is parallelised. We recommend using \c oomph-lib's  wrapper to the 
  parallel Krylov subspace solvers from the
  <a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov/">
  Trilinos </a> library (see 
  <a href="../../../the_distribution/html/index.html#external_dist"> 
  the \c oomph-lib installation page</a> for details on how to install
  this) instead. The interfaces are identical to those
  used to call these solvers in serial; see 
  <a href="../../../linear_solvers/html/index.html"> the linear solver
  tutorial</a> for details.
  \n\n
- \c oomph-lib's block preconditioning framework is fully 
  parallelised and can be used in the same way as in a serial code.


########################################################################

<HR>

\subsection self_tests How to include parallel demo codes into the self-tests

- The configure flag \c --with-mpi-self-tests includes 
  \c oomph-lib's parallel demo driver codes into the self-tests 
  executed when \c make \c check is run. The self-tests
  require the executable to be run on two processors and the command 
  that spawns a two-processor parallel job on the target
  machine must be specified as an argument to the configure flag. 
  For example, under <a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/">LAM</a>
  \n\n
  \code
  --with-mpi-self-tests="mpirun -np 2"
  \endcode
  \n
  Some self-tests are performed with a greater number of processors.
  To perform these tests as part of the \c make \c test procedure,
  add the configure flag  \c --with-mpi-self-tests-variablenp
  to the configure options. Its argument has to specify how to spawn
  an mpi job on an arbitary number of processors, using the
  placeholder \c OOMPHNP for the number of processors. E.g. 
  \n\n
  \code
  --with-mpi-self-tests-variablenp="mpirun -np OOMPHNP"
  \endcode
  \n
  It is easiest to add the appropriate lines to the
  <code>config/configure_options/current</code> file before
  building/installing \c oomph-lib with <code>autogen.sh</code>.
  \n\n
  \b NOTE: When using LAM, make sure your MPI demons are started
  before running the parallel self-tests, e.g. by using the \c lamboot 
  command, otherwise the self-tests will fail.

\section domain_decomposition Distribution of problems by domain decomposition

By default each processor stores the entire \c Problem object, which
means that all data is available on all processors. As a result the
size of the problem is limited by the smallest amount of memory
available on any of the processors. In addition, the mesh adaptation 
does not benefit from parallel processing because each 
processor must adapt its own copy of the entire mesh, even though it
operates on a subset of the elements when assembling the Jacobian 
matrix.

To address this problem, \c oomph-lib's domain decomposition
procedures allow a \c Problem
to be distributed over multiple processors so that each processor 
holds a fraction of the \c Problem's elements, which 
can lead to substantial reductions in memory usage per processor and
allows the mesh adaptation to be performed in parallel.

\subsection how_to_distribute Basic usage: How to distribute a simple problem

- In most cases the problem distribution is extremely
  straightforward. Given an existing serial driver code,
  modified by the addition of calls to \c MPI_Helpers::init(...) 
  and \c  MPI_Helpers::finalize(), the function
  \n\n
  \code
  Problem::distribute()
  \endcode
  \n
  can be called at any point \b after the \c Problem has been 
  constructed and equation numbers have been assigned 
  (i.e. at a point at which \c Problem::newton_solve()
  could be called), but \b before any <b>non</b>-uniform mesh refinement has 
  taken place. Equation numbering is required because 
  the automatic distribution procedure uses the global
  equation numbering scheme to identify interactions between elements
  and attempts to store strongly-coupled elements on the same
  processor. 
  \n\n
  After the call to \c Problem::distribute() each processor
  holds a sub-set of the \c Problem's elements: those elements
  whose contribution to the Jacobian are assembled by the processor, 
  and additional "halo" elements
  that are retained to facilitate the subsequent mesh adaptation.
  (Halo elements are discussed in the \ref how_it_works
  below). We note that the meshes' boundary lookup schemes 
  are updated during the
  distribution process so that \c Mesh::nboundary_element(b) returns the
  number of elements on the processor 
  that are adjacent to boundary \c b. Hence, 
  functions that were written (in serial) to
  update time-dependent boundary conditions on a mesh's boundary
  nodes, say, continue to work in parallel without requiring any
  modifications. 
  \n\n
- Now that each processor holds a subset of the \c Problem's 
  elements, it is sensible to modify the post-processing 
  routines such that output files are labeled by the processor 
  number:
  \n\n 
  \dontinclude adaptive_driven_cavity.cc
  \skipline start_of_doc_solution
  \until end_of_doc_solution
  \n 
  Without such a modification multiple processors will attempt to
  write to the same file, leading to incomplete output if/when the file 
  produced by one processor is overwritten by another. 
  By default, \c oomph-lib's mesh-based output functions do
  not include output from halo elements; this can be re-enabled or
  disabled by calls to
  \n\n 
  \code
  Mesh::enable_output_of_halo_elements()
  \endcode
  \n
  or
  \n\n
  \code
  Mesh::disable_output_of halo_elements()
  \endcode
  \n 
  respectively.
  \n\n
- Other, equally-straightforward modifications to existing driver codes
  tend to be required if the serial version of the code contains explicit
  references to individual elements or nodes, <em> e.g. </em> 
  pinning a pressure
  value in a Navier--Stokes computation with enclosed boundaries. 
  In such cases, it is important to remember that, once the problem 
  is distributed, \b (i) not every processor has direct access to a
  specific element (or node), and  \b (ii) the pointer to the "first" 
  element in a mesh (say) points to a different element on each processor.
  The particular example of pinning a pressure degree of freedom in a
  Navier--Stokes problem is discussed in detail in the 
  <a href="../../adaptive_driven_cavity/html/index.html">adaptive
  driven cavity tutorial</a>.

\subsection how_it_works Overview of the implementation of Problem distribution

  The main task of the \c Problem::distribute() function is
to distribute the \c Problem's global mesh (possibly
comprising multiple sub-meshes) amongst the processors so that 
<b>(a)</b> the storage requirements on each processor are reduced;
<b>(b)</b>  during the mesh adaptation each processor only acts
on a fraction of the overall mesh; while ensuring that <b>(c)</b> 
communication between processors required to synchronise any shared 
 data structures is minimised. 

The figure below shows a conceptual sketch of the parallelisation
strategy adopted. For simplicity, we shall restrict the discussion
to the 2D case and ignore various complications that arise with more 
complicated mesh partitionings.


 The initial distribution of a problem proceeds in two stages:
 
- <b>Initial refinement and partitioning</b>
  \n\n
  Each processor constructs the same \c Problem object, 
  using a (typically very coarse) initial mesh; in the figure below,
  the mesh contains a single four-node quad. Repeated
  calls to  \c Problem::refine_uniformly() should be made to increase the
  number of elements sufficiently for a sensible
  mesh partitioning --- for example, 
  there should be at least as many elements as
  processors. By default, 
  <A HREF="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/">METIS</A> 
  is used to associate each element
  with a unique processor. Alternatively, user-defined distributions 
  may be specified via a vector that contains the processor number to be
  associated with each element. Nodes located in the interior of a
  processor's patch of elements are associated with that processor;
  nodes shared by elements associated
  with different processors are associated with the highest-numbered
  processor.
  \n\n
- <b>Identification of halo[ed] nodes/elements and pruning</b>
  \n\n
   The elements and nodes required by each processor must now be determined.
   Each processor retains its own elements:
   those elements associated with the processor by the partitioning
   process. In addition,
   each processor retains a single layer of elements adjacent to 
   its own elements, and their nodes.  Nodes that lie directly
   on the boundary between this layer and the processor's own elements
   are shared between processors and are associated
   with the highest-numbered processor, as explained above.
   These additional elements/nodes that are retained but not associated
   with the processor are termed ``halo'' elements/nodes. Conversely, 
   objects are termed  ``haloed'' if they are associated with the
   processor,  but they have halo counterparts on other processors. 
   [It is possible
    to request that all elements in a mesh are retained as halo
    elements. This is useful
    in certain free-boundary problems; see the section 
   \ref alg_node_update below for details].
  \n\n
   At this stage of the process, each processor
   has access to the entire mesh and it is, therefore, possible to establish 
   a consistent numbering scheme for halo[ed] elements/nodes.
  Once this information has been set up, any superfluous nodes and elements
  are deleted and the mesh's boundary lookup-schemes (required to identify the
  nodes and elements located adjacent to domain boundaries) and
  neighbour information for adaptive refinement are re-generated. 
  Finally, each processor  independently assigns equation numbers for 
  its associated (non-halo) elements and nodes; the equation
  numbers are then synchronised between processors.

@I w 0.75\textwidth decomposition "Sketch illustrating the phases of the parallel mesh adaptation procedure for a problem that is distributed over four processors. The columns illustrate the evolution of the mesh on each of the four processors. The colours of the objects indicate which processor is associated with them. "

  Aside from the initial refinement process, 
  the functionality described above is implemented in a single
  function, \c Problem::distribute(). Following its execution
  on all processors, each processor can assemble its contribution to the 
  distributed Jacobian matrix and residual vector, required by
  \c oomph-lib's parallel linear solvers, using only 
  to locally stored non-halo objects. Once the Newton correction 
  to the unknowns has been computed, each processor updates the unknowns 
  associated with its elements and nodes, before MPI-based 
  communication is employed to update the unknowns stored at 
  the processors' halo nodes.

  After a problem has been distributed, further mesh refinement can 
  be performed in parallel using the existing mesh adaptation 
  procedures on the (partial) meshes held on the different 
  processors. For spatially non-uniform refinement, each haloed
  element communicates whether or not it is to be refined to its halo
  counterparts before the adaptation takes place.
  Any nodes created during the refinement are associated 
  with a unique processor, using the rules described above, and halo[ed] 
  nodes are identified and added to the appropriate lookup schemes. 
  These steps are performed automatically
  when \c Problem::refine_uniformly() or any of the other
  mesh adaptation routines within \c oomph-lib are executed.

<strong> Optional pruning of superfluous halo[ed] nodes and 
  elements </strong>

  The parallel efficiency of the distributed mesh adaptation
  (in terms of the memory required to hold the partial meshes, and 
  in terms of the CPU time required for their adaptation) is 
  limited by the fact that each processor must adapt not only 
  the \f$N_{\rm in \ charge}\f$ elements it is in charge of, 
  but also its \f$N_{\rm halo}\f$ halo elements. We define the efficiency 
  of the problem distribution as
  \f[ e_{dist} = 
  \frac{N_{\rm in \ charge}}{N_{\rm halo} + N_{\rm in \ charge}} 
  \le 1, \f]
  where the equality could only be achieved in the absence of any 
  halo elements. 

  When the mesh is first distributed, the halo layer has a 
depth of one element, but repeated mesh refinement can make the halo
layers (the original halo elements and their sons) much thicker than a
single-element layer. Thus, to a large extent, the efficiency is determined 
during the initial problem 
  distribution and at that stage of the process it
  can only be improved by <b>(i)</b> increasing the number of non-distributed
  initial mesh refinements; <b>(ii)</b> reducing the number of
  processors. Since both options reduce the parallelism they are not
  desirable. It is possible, however, to improve the parallel 
  efficiency by  pruning superfluous halo[ed] elements after each
  mesh refinement by  calling the function
\n\n
\code
Problem::prune_halo_elements_and_nodes()
\endcode
\n
as illustrated in the figure. 
If this is done 
  after every mesh adaptation \f$ e_{dist}\f$  increases significantly as 
  the refinement proceeds. However, the pruning of halo[ed] nodes and elements 
  makes the refinement irreversible and the mesh(es) involved
can no longer be unrefined below the previous highest level of uniform
refinement.

\subsection advanced Customising the distribution

 The procedures described above are completely sufficient 
 for straightforward problems, <em> e.g. </em> 
 a single mesh containing single-physics elements. For
 less-straightforward problems, <em> e.g. </em> those that involve
 interactions between multiple meshes, the interactions must be set up
 both <strong> before </strong> and <strong> after </strong> the
 distribution. The functions 
\n\n
\code
Problem::actions_before_distribute()
\endcode 
\n
and
\n\n
\code
Problem::actions_after_distribute()
\endcode 
\n
can be used to perform any additional commands required to complete
 the setup of the problem after distribution. In many cases, these
 functions will contain the same commands as those required in the
 equivalent \c Problem::actions_before_adapt() and \c
 Problem::actions_after_adapt() functions used during mesh adaptation.

\subsubsection face_elements Distributing problems involving FaceElements

\c FaceElements are typically used to apply Neumann/traction-type
boundary conditions; see the tutorials that discuss the
application of such boundary conditions in
<a href="../../../poisson/two_d_poisson_flux_bc/html/index.html">
Poisson</a> or
<a href="../../../navier_stokes/rayleigh_traction_channel/html/index.html">
Navier-Stokes</a> equations. Since the \c FaceElements
that apply the Neumann boundary conditions are attached
to "bulk" elements that may disappear during mesh adaptation, 
we generally recommend to store the (pointers to the) 
\c FaceElements in a separate mesh, and to use
the \c Problem::actions_before_adapt() and 
\c Problem::actions_after_adapt() functions to detach and re-attach 
the \c FaceElements to/from the bulk elements before and after the
mesh adaptation.

  The same issues arise during the problem distribution: A 
\c FaceElement that was created before the problem was distributed
may have been attached to a bulk element that is deleted when the
distribution is performed, resulting in obvious (and disastrous) 
consequences. We therefore recommend using the functions
\n\n
\code
Problem::actions_before_distribute()
\endcode 
\n
and
\n\n
\code
Problem::actions_after_distribute()
\endcode 
\n
to detach and re-attach any \c FaceElements before and after the
problem distribution. In this context it is important to note that:
\n
-# The \c FaceElements \b should be available before \c Problem::distribute() 
   is called to allow the load-balancing routines to take their 
   presence into account. 
   \n\n
-# \c FaceElements that are attached to halo (bulk-)elements become
   halo-elements themselves.
.
Further details are provided in  
<a href="../../two_d_poisson_flux_bc_adapt/html/index.html">another 
tutorial</a> which explains the modifications
to the serial driver code required to distribute
a Poisson problem with Neumann boundary conditions.

\subsubsection multi_domain Distributing multi-domain problems

Multi-domain problems involve interactions
between PDEs that are defined in different domains, such as
fluid-structure interaction problems.
Within \c oomph-lib, multi-domain problems typically involve
elements, derived from the \c ElementWithExternalElement class,  
that store pointers to any "external" elements that take part
in the interaction. These "external" elements are
determined by helper functions such as 
 \c FSI_functions::setup_fluid_load_info_for_solid_elements(...) or
\c Multi_domain_functions::setup_multi_domain_interactions(...). 
The appropriate helper functions must be called in the function 
\c Problem::actions_after_distribute() to ensure that the interactions
are correctly set up once the problem has been distributed.

The helper function \c
Multi_domain_functions::locate_external_elements() has been written to
work even after a problem has been distributed and uses the following
algorithm:
-# Loop over all (non-halo) \c ElementWithExternalElements
   and try to locate the "external" elements (<em> e.g.</em>  fluid elements
   adjacent to an elastic wall in an fluid-structure interaction
   problem) on the current processor. 
   If the required "external" element is found
   locally, the \c ElementWithExternalElement stores a pointer to it.
   \n\n
-# If the "external" element cannot be found locally, MPI-based
   communication is employed to find the "external" element on one
   of the other processors. Once found, a halo-copy of the "external"
   element (and its nodes) is made on the current processor and a
   pointer to the halo-element is stored. These "external" halo elements 
   and nodes are stored in the appropriate mesh, <em> i.e.</em>
    in an FSI problem, the
   "external" fluid elements are added to the fluid mesh. 
   \n\n
.

"External" halo[ed] elements are automatically included in any
halo/haloed synchronisation operations performed when assigning
equation numbers, or updating unknowns during the Newton iteration,
etc. 


The procedure discussed above has the following important consequence:
\n
- When an "external" halo element is created we also automatically create
  halo-copies of those of its nodes that do not already exist
  on the current processor. Such nodes are stored as "external" halo nodes 
  and they are automatically synchronised with their non-halo
  counterparts on other processors. However, synchronisation of nodes
  does not (and cannot) include the specification of auxiliary node 
  update functions (such as the function 
  \c FSI_functions::apply_no_slip_on_moving_wall(...) which automatically 
  applies the no-slip condition on moving fluid-solid interfaces). 
  Such functions should therefore be re-assigned to the appropriate nodes
  after \c FSI_functions::setup_fluid_load_info_for_solid_elements() 
  has been called. This is exactly equivalent to the sequence of steps
  required following an adaptive mesh refinement; see <em> e.g.</em> the
  <a href="../../../interaction/fsi_collapsible_channel_adapt/html/index.html#before_and_after">tutorial
  discussing the adaptive solution of the collapsible channel problem</a>
  for a more detailed discussion of this issue. We note that "external"
  halo-nodes are added to the mesh's boundary lookup schemes, so the
  specification of auxiliary node update functions for all nodes
  on a given mesh boundary does not require any further modification
  to the serial code.  
.

\subsubsection alg_node_update Distributing problems involving meshes with algebraic node updates

\c oomph-lib provides a variety of algebraic node-update methods. 
These allow the fast and sparse update of the nodal positions 
in response to changes in the domain boundaries. The shape and 
position of such boundaries is typically represented by one or 
more \c GeomObjects. If the motion of the boundary is prescribed, 
(as in the case of the
<a href="../../../navier_stokes/osc_ellipse/html/index.html">flow 
inside an oscillating ellipse</a>, say) no modifications are
required when the meshes are used in a distributed problem.

In order to minimise communication, the design decision was taken
that any \c GeomObjects defining the position of domain boundaries
must be available on all processors after the problem is distributed. 
Thus, if the \c GeomObject is actually a \c MeshAsGeomObject,
a compound \c GeomObject formed from a mesh of \c FiniteElements,
then all the elements in the mesh, or all elements required to
construct the mesh,  must be retained as halo elements on
every processor. This leads to a 
slight increase in the overall storage requirements 
(because none of the elements involved in the interaction are deleted
when the problem is distributed) but it means that the entire 
\c GeomObject remains accessible to the fluid mesh without invoking
MPI communications. Two functions can be used to specify that elements
must be retained:
\n\n
\code
Mesh::keep_all_elements_as_halos()

\n
keeps every element in the \c Mesh available to every processor,
and
\code
GeneralisedElement::must_be_kept_as_halo()
\endcode
\n
can be called for a particular element to ensure that it is kept
available to every processor.

We stress that the increase in storage requirements due to the
retention of these elements is minimal because the  
elements are only located along the (lower-dimensional) boundaries 
of the domain. For instance, in the 
<a href="../../../interaction/fsi_collapsible_channel_algebraic/html/index.html">collapsible 
channel problem</a> the 1D mesh of beam elements
bounds the 2D mesh of fluid elements; in
<A HREF="../../../interaction/turek_flag/html/index.html">Turek and 
Hron's FSI benchmark problem</a>, the 2D fluid domain is bounded
by a 1D mesh of \c FSISolidTractionElements, and so on.

Examples of the implementation of these ideas are given for the  
<a href="../../fsi_channel_with_leaflet/html/index.html">flow past an
elastic leaflet</a> and <a href="../../turek_flag/html/index.html"> 
Turek and Hron's FSI benchmark problem </a>.

\section mpidetails Further MPI Details

- \c oomph-lib mirrors the MPI C bindings with the methods 
  \c MPI_Helpers::init(...) and \c MPI_Helpers::finalize(); 
  they call the methods \c MPI_Init(...) and \c MPI_Finalize()
  respectively. In addition, these methods automatically create 
  (and destroy) a new instance of \c MPI_Comm  with the same set of 
  processes as \c MPI_COMM_WORLD but with a different communication context. 
  This \c MPI_Comm instance is accessible through 
  \c MPI_Helpers::Communicator_pt which
  returns a pointer to an \c OomphCommunicator object.
- An \c OomphCommunicator is \c oomph-lib's object oriented wrapper to an 
  \c MPI_Comm.
- Under normal operation, a user does not need to specify the
  \c OomphCommunicator for any object -- this is all handled
  automatically by \c oomph-lib. For example, on construction a \c
  Problem will use the \c MPI_Helpers communicator; a \c LinearSolver 
  will use the corresponding \c Problem communicator; and a 
  \c Preconditioner will
  use the corresponding \c IterativeLinearSolver communicator.

\section problem Trouble-shooting and debugging

\subsection checking_and_documenting Debugging and documenting the distribution

Once a problem has been distributed, the function
\code
Problem::check_halo_schemes()
\endcode
can be called to check that the halo lookup schemes for each mesh 
are set up correctly.

Details about the mesh distribution can be generated by
calling
\code
Mesh::doc_mesh_distribution(DocInfo& doc_info)
\endcode
which outputs the elements, nodes, halo(ed) elements, halo(ed) nodes, mesh, 
boundary elements and boundary nodes on each processor.  This routine
is automatically called when \c Problem::distribute() is called with a
\c DocInfo object whose \c Doc_flag is set to true (the default behaviour).

\subsection parallel_debug Debugging parallel code

Parallel code can obviously fail in many more ways than a code
that runs on a single processor. Here is a procedure that 
allows basic parallel debugging without requiring access to 
expensive commercial tools such as totalview, say.
(The instructions below assume that you use 
<a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/">LAM</a> as your MPI installation; 
they can probably be modified to work with other versions of MPI, too). 

Let's assume you use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a> 
as your debugger. To debug a serial code
with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a> you would 
load the executable <code>a.out</code> into the debugger using
the command
\code
gdb ./a.out
\endcode
on the command line. Once inside 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a>, you run 
the code by typing "run". If the code crashes, typing "where" will tell
you in which line of the code the crash occured, and it will also
provide a traceback of the function calls that got you to this
point. 

 To do this in parallel, we have to run each (parallel) instance of
the code within its own <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a>
session. To this, create the following three files:
- A shell script \c mpidbg that must be executable, which contains:
\code
#! /bin/bash
mpirun $1 $2 -x DISPLAY rungdb.sh -x cmds.gdb
\endcode
- The executable file \c rungdb.sh must be in the same directory as \c
mpidbg and contain the following
\code
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running GDB on node `hostname`"
echo $DISPLAY
xterm -geometry 200x40 -e gdb $*
exit 0
\endcode
- Finally the \c cmds.gdb file should also be in the same directory
and must contain the \c run command (so that all processors start
their <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a> session
simultaneously), and may also include other commands such as \c set
\c args \c command-line-arguments, and so on.

Then, to run the debugger in parallel on 3 processors for the
exectuable \c a.out, the command would be
\code
mpidbg -np 3 ./a.out 
\endcode
Once the command is issued, an \c xterm window will be opened for each
processor, and if a crash occurs on any processor, the usual
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">gdb</a>
commands (\c back, \c up, \c down, \c quit and so on) may be used
within any of the \c xterm sessions where a crash has taken place.
