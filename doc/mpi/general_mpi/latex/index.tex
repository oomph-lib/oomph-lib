{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} is designed so that, provided the library is compiled with MPI support, discussed below in \mbox{\hyperlink{index_basics}{Basic parallel usage}}, many of the most computationally-\/expensive phases of a typical computation are automatically performed in parallel. Examples of \char`\"{}automatically parallelised\char`\"{} tasks include
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The assembly of the Jacobian matrix and the residual vector in Newton\textquotesingle{}s method.
\item Error estimation.
\item The solution of the linear systems within the Newton iteration, and any preconditioning operations performed within {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} \href{../../../mpi/block_preconditioners/html/index.html}{\texttt{ block-\/preconditioning framework}} which relies heavily on the library\textquotesingle{}s \href{../../../mpi/distributed_linear_algebra_infrastructure/html/index.html}{\texttt{ distributed linear algebra infrastructure.}}
\end{DoxyItemize}The only parallel task that requires user intervention is the distribution of a problem over multiple processors so that each processor stores a subset of the elements. For straightforward problems, a single call to {\ttfamily Problem\+::distribute()} suffices. Furthermore, the majority of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} multi-\/physics helper functions ({\itshape  e.\+g.} the automatic setup of the fluid load on solid elements in FSI problems; the determination of \char`\"{}source elements\char`\"{} in multi-\/field problems; etc) can be used in distributed problems. For less-\/straightforward problems, the user may have to intervene in the distribution process and/or be aware of the consequences of the distribution. Hence, the section \mbox{\hyperlink{index_domain_decomposition}{Distribution of problems by domain decomposition}} provides an overview of the underlying design used for problem distribution within {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}. A number of \href{../../../example_code_list/html/index.html\#parallel}{\texttt{ demo driver codes for distributed problems}} are provided and any additional issues are discussed in the accompanying tutorials.

 Running the code on multiple processors should immediately lead to a speedup, although this depends on the specific problem. In most applications, the most computationally-\/expensive tasks are the setup of the Jacobian matrix and the solution of the linear systems. When a driver code is run on multiple processors, each processor assembles contributions to the Jacobian matrix from a different subset of the elements, dividing the work of the assembly between processors. In our experience, the assembly of the Jacobian matrix tends to scale very well with the number of processors. The parallel performance of the (third-\/party) linear solvers available from within {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} varies greatly and their performance is also strongly dependent on the underlying hardware, {\itshape  e.\+g.} the speed of your machine\textquotesingle{}s interconnects, etc. ~\newline
~\newline

\item The MPI header file {\ttfamily mpi.\+h} is included in {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} generic header, so it is not necessary to include it in the driver code. The functions {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Helpers\+::init(...)} and {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Helpers\+::finalize()} call their MPI counterparts, {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Init(...)} and {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Finalize()}, which {\bfseries{must}} {\bfseries{not}} be called again. Note also that the {\ttfamily main(...)} function must take arguments which are then passed into the {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Helpers\+::init(...)} function. ~\newline
~\newline

\item The command used to run a parallel job depends on your particular MPI installation. If you use \href{http://www.open-mpi.org/}{\texttt{ Open\+MPI}}, for example, the executable {\ttfamily parallel\+\_\+executable} is run on, say, four processors by issuing the command ~\newline

\hypertarget{index_domain_decomposition}{}\doxysection{Distribution of problems by domain decomposition}\label{index_domain_decomposition}
By default each processor stores the entire {\ttfamily Problem} object, which means that all data is available on all processors. As a result the size of the problem is limited by the smallest amount of memory available on any of the processors. In addition, the mesh adaptation does not benefit from parallel processing because each processor must adapt its own copy of the entire mesh, even though it operates on a subset of the elements when assembling the Jacobian matrix.

To address this problem, {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} domain decomposition procedures allow a {\ttfamily Problem} to be distributed over multiple processors so that each processor holds a fraction of the {\ttfamily Problem\textquotesingle{}s} elements, which can lead to substantial reductions in memory usage per processor and allows the mesh adaptation to be performed in parallel.

\hypertarget{index_how_to_distribute}{}\doxysubsection{Basic usage\+: How to distribute a simple problem}\label{index_how_to_distribute}

~\newline

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

 ~\newline
 can be called at any point {\bfseries{after}} the {\ttfamily Problem} has been constructed and equation numbers have been assigned (i.\+e. at a point at which {\ttfamily Problem\+::newton\+\_\+solve()} could be called), but {\bfseries{before}} any {\bfseries{non}}-\/uniform mesh refinement has taken place. Equation numbering is required because the automatic distribution procedure uses the global equation numbering scheme to identify interactions between elements and attempts to store strongly-\/coupled elements on the same processor. ~\newline
~\newline
 After the call to {\ttfamily Problem\+::distribute()} each processor holds a sub-\/set of the {\ttfamily Problem\textquotesingle{}s} elements\+: those elements whose contribution to the Jacobian are assembled by the processor, and additional \char`\"{}halo\char`\"{} elements that are retained to facilitate the subsequent mesh adaptation. (Halo elements are discussed in the \mbox{\hyperlink{index_how_it_works}{Overview of the implementation of Problem distribution}} below). We note that the meshes\textquotesingle{} boundary lookup schemes are updated during the distribution process so that {\ttfamily Mesh\+::nboundary\+\_\+element(b)} returns the number of elements on the processor that are adjacent to boundary {\ttfamily b}. Hence, functions that were written (in serial) to update time-\/dependent boundary conditions on a mesh\textquotesingle{}s boundary nodes, say, continue to work in parallel without requiring any modifications. ~\newline

\hypertarget{index_how_it_works}{}\doxysubsection{Overview of the implementation of Problem distribution}\label{index_how_it_works}
The main task of the {\ttfamily Problem\+::distribute()} function is to distribute the {\ttfamily Problem\textquotesingle{}s} global mesh (possibly comprising multiple sub-\/meshes) amongst the processors so that {\bfseries{(a)}} the storage requirements on each processor are reduced; {\bfseries{(b)}} during the mesh adaptation each processor only acts on a fraction of the overall mesh; while ensuring that {\bfseries{(c)}} communication between processors required to synchronise any shared data structures is minimised.

The figure below shows a conceptual sketch of the parallelisation strategy adopted. For simplicity, we shall restrict the discussion to the 2D case and ignore various complications that arise with more complicated mesh partitionings.

The initial distribution of a problem proceeds in two stages\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Initial refinement and partitioning}} ~\newline
~\newline
 Each processor constructs the same {\ttfamily Problem} object, using a (typically very coarse) initial mesh; in the figure below, the mesh contains a single four-\/node quad. Repeated calls to {\ttfamily Problem\+::refine\+\_\+uniformly()} should be made to increase the number of elements sufficiently for a sensible mesh partitioning --- for example, there should be at least as many elements as processors. By default, \href{http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/}{\texttt{ METIS}} is used to associate each element with a unique processor. Alternatively, user-\/defined distributions may be specified via a vector that contains the processor number to be associated with each element. Nodes located in the interior of a processor\textquotesingle{}s patch of elements are associated with that processor; nodes shared by elements associated with different processors are associated with the highest-\/numbered processor. ~\newline
~\newline

\item {\bfseries{Identification of halo\mbox{[}ed\mbox{]} nodes/elements and pruning}} ~\newline
~\newline
 The elements and nodes required by each processor must now be determined. Each processor retains its own elements\+: those elements associated with the processor by the partitioning process. In addition, each processor retains a single layer of elements adjacent to its own elements, and their nodes. Nodes that lie directly on the boundary between this layer and the processor\textquotesingle{}s own elements are shared between processors and are associated with the highest-\/numbered processor, as explained above. These additional elements/nodes that are retained but not associated with the processor are termed {\ttfamily halo\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} elements/nodes. Conversely, objects are termed}haloed\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} if they are associated with the processor, but they have halo counterparts on other processors. \mbox{[}It is possible to request that all elements in a mesh are retained as halo elements. This is useful in certain free-\/boundary problems; see the section \mbox{\hyperlink{index_alg_node_update}{Distributing problems involving meshes with algebraic node updates}} below for details\mbox{]}. ~\newline
~\newline
 At this stage of the process, each processor has access to the entire mesh and it is, therefore, possible to establish a consistent numbering scheme for halo\mbox{[}ed\mbox{]} elements/nodes. Once this information has been set up, any superfluous nodes and elements are deleted and the mesh\textquotesingle{}s boundary lookup-\/schemes (required to identify the nodes and elements located adjacent to domain boundaries) and neighbour information for adaptive refinement are re-\/generated. Finally, each processor independently assigns equation numbers for its associated (non-\/halo) elements and nodes; the equation numbers are then synchronised between processors.
\end{DoxyItemize}

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{decomposition}
\doxyfigcaption{Sketch illustrating the phases of the parallel mesh adaptation procedure for a problem that is distributed over four processors. The columns illustrate the evolution of the mesh on each of the four processors. The colours of the objects indicate which processor is associated with them. }
\end{DoxyImage}


Aside from the initial refinement process, the functionality described above is implemented in a single function, {\ttfamily Problem\+::distribute()}. Following its execution on all processors, each processor can assemble its contribution to the distributed Jacobian matrix and residual vector, required by {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} parallel linear solvers, using only to locally stored non-\/halo objects. Once the Newton correction to the unknowns has been computed, each processor updates the unknowns associated with its elements and nodes, before MPI-\/based communication is employed to update the unknowns stored at the processors\textquotesingle{} halo nodes.

After a problem has been distributed, further mesh refinement can be performed in parallel using the existing mesh adaptation procedures on the (partial) meshes held on the different processors. For spatially non-\/uniform refinement, each haloed element communicates whether or not it is to be refined to its halo counterparts before the adaptation takes place. Any nodes created during the refinement are associated with a unique processor, using the rules described above, and halo\mbox{[}ed\mbox{]} nodes are identified and added to the appropriate lookup schemes. These steps are performed automatically when {\ttfamily Problem\+::refine\+\_\+uniformly()} or any of the other mesh adaptation routines within {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} are executed.

{\bfseries{ Optional pruning of superfluous halo\mbox{[}ed\mbox{]} nodes and elements }}

The parallel efficiency of the distributed mesh adaptation (in terms of the memory required to hold the partial meshes, and in terms of the CPU time required for their adaptation) is limited by the fact that each processor must adapt not only the $N_{\rm in \ charge}$ elements it is in charge of, but also its $N_{\rm halo}$ halo elements. We define the efficiency of the problem distribution as \[ e_{dist} = \frac{N_{\rm in \ charge}}{N_{\rm halo} + N_{\rm in \ charge}} \le 1, \] where the equality could only be achieved in the absence of any halo elements.

When the mesh is first distributed, the halo layer has a depth of one element, but repeated mesh refinement can make the halo layers (the original halo elements and their sons) much thicker than a single-\/element layer. Thus, to a large extent, the efficiency is determined during the initial problem distribution and at that stage of the process it can only be improved by {\bfseries{(i)}} increasing the number of non-\/distributed initial mesh refinements; {\bfseries{(ii)}} reducing the number of processors. Since both options reduce the parallelism they are not desirable. It is possible, however, to improve the parallel efficiency by pruning superfluous halo\mbox{[}ed\mbox{]} elements after each mesh refinement by calling the function ~\newline
~\newline

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Problem::prune\_halo\_elements\_and\_nodes()}

\end{DoxyCode}
 ~\newline
as illustrated in the figure. If this is done after every mesh adaptation $ e_{dist}$ increases significantly as the refinement proceeds. However, the pruning of halo\mbox{[}ed\mbox{]} nodes and elements makes the refinement irreversible and the mesh(es) involved can no longer be unrefined below the previous highest level of uniform refinement.

\hypertarget{index_face_elements}{}\doxysubsubsection{Distributing problems involving Face\+Elements}\label{index_face_elements}
{\ttfamily Face\+Elements} are typically used to apply Neumann/traction-\/type boundary conditions; see the tutorials that discuss the application of such boundary conditions in \href{../../../poisson/two_d_poisson_flux_bc/html/index.html}{\texttt{ Poisson}} or \href{../../../navier_stokes/rayleigh_traction_channel/html/index.html}{\texttt{ Navier-\/\+Stokes}} equations. Since the {\ttfamily Face\+Elements} that apply the Neumann boundary conditions are attached to \char`\"{}bulk\char`\"{} elements that may disappear during mesh adaptation, we generally recommend to store the (pointers to the) {\ttfamily Face\+Elements} in a separate mesh, and to use the {\ttfamily Problem\+::actions\+\_\+before\+\_\+adapt()} and {\ttfamily Problem\+::actions\+\_\+after\+\_\+adapt()} functions to detach and re-\/attach the {\ttfamily Face\+Elements} to/from the bulk elements before and after the mesh adaptation.

The same issues arise during the problem distribution\+: A {\ttfamily Face\+Element} that was created before the problem was distributed may have been attached to a bulk element that is deleted when the distribution is performed, resulting in obvious (and disastrous) consequences. We therefore recommend using the functions ~\newline

\hypertarget{index_multi_domain}{}\doxysubsubsection{Distributing multi-\/domain problems}\label{index_multi_domain}
Multi-\/domain problems involve interactions between PDEs that are defined in different domains, such as fluid-\/structure interaction problems. Within {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}, multi-\/domain problems typically involve elements, derived from the {\ttfamily Element\+With\+External\+Element} class, ~\newline
 that store pointers to any \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} elements that take part in the interaction. These \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} elements are determined by helper functions such as {\ttfamily FSI\+\_\+functions\+::setup\+\_\+fluid\+\_\+load\+\_\+info\+\_\+for\+\_\+solid\+\_\+elements(...)} or {\ttfamily Multi\+\_\+domain\+\_\+functions\+::setup\+\_\+multi\+\_\+domain\+\_\+interactions(...)}. The appropriate helper functions must be called in the function {\ttfamily Problem\+::actions\+\_\+after\+\_\+distribute()} to ensure that the interactions are correctly set up once the problem has been distributed.

The helper function {\ttfamily Multi\+\_\+domain\+\_\+functions\+::locate\+\_\+external\+\_\+elements()} has been written to work even after a problem has been distributed and uses the following algorithm\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Loop over all (non-\/halo) {\ttfamily Element\+With\+External\+Elements} and try to locate the \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} elements ({\itshape  e.\+g.} fluid elements adjacent to an elastic wall in an fluid-\/structure interaction problem) on the current processor. If the required \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} element is found locally, the {\ttfamily Element\+With\+External\+Element} stores a pointer to it. ~\newline
~\newline

\item If the \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} element cannot be found locally, MPI-\/based communication is employed to find the \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} element on one of the other processors. Once found, a halo-\/copy of the \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} element (and its nodes) is made on the current processor and a pointer to the halo-\/element is stored. These \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} halo elements and nodes are stored in the appropriate mesh, {\itshape  i.\+e.} in an FSI problem, the \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} fluid elements are added to the fluid mesh. ~\newline
~\newline

\end{DoxyEnumerate}\char`\"{}\+External\char`\"{} halo\mbox{[}ed\mbox{]} elements are automatically included in any halo/haloed synchronisation operations performed when assigning equation numbers, or updating unknowns during the Newton iteration, etc.

The procedure discussed above has the following important consequence\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When an \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} halo element is created we also automatically create halo-\/copies of those of its nodes that do not already exist on the current processor. Such nodes are stored as \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} halo nodes and they are automatically synchronised with their non-\/halo counterparts on other processors. However, synchronisation of nodes does not (and cannot) include the specification of auxiliary node update functions (such as the function {\ttfamily FSI\+\_\+functions\+::apply\+\_\+no\+\_\+slip\+\_\+on\+\_\+moving\+\_\+wall(...)} which automatically applies the no-\/slip condition on moving fluid-\/solid interfaces). Such functions should therefore be re-\/assigned to the appropriate nodes after {\ttfamily FSI\+\_\+functions\+::setup\+\_\+fluid\+\_\+load\+\_\+info\+\_\+for\+\_\+solid\+\_\+elements()} has been called. This is exactly equivalent to the sequence of steps required following an adaptive mesh refinement; see {\itshape  e.\+g.} the \href{../../../interaction/fsi_collapsible_channel_adapt/html/index.html\#before_and_after}{\texttt{ tutorial discussing the adaptive solution of the collapsible channel problem}} for a more detailed discussion of this issue. We note that \char`\"{}external\char`\"{} halo-\/nodes are added to the mesh\textquotesingle{}s boundary lookup schemes, so the specification of auxiliary node update functions for all nodes on a given mesh boundary does not require any further modification to the serial code. ~\newline

\hypertarget{index_alg_node_update}{}\doxysubsubsection{Distributing problems involving meshes with algebraic node updates}\label{index_alg_node_update}
{\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} provides a variety of algebraic node-\/update methods. These allow the fast and sparse update of the nodal positions in response to changes in the domain boundaries. The shape and position of such boundaries is typically represented by one or more {\ttfamily Geom\+Objects}. If the motion of the boundary is prescribed, (as in the case of the \href{../../../navier_stokes/osc_ellipse/html/index.html}{\texttt{ flow inside an oscillating ellipse}}, say) no modifications are required when the meshes are used in a distributed problem.

In order to minimise communication, the design decision was taken that any {\ttfamily Geom\+Objects} defining the position of domain boundaries must be available on all processors after the problem is distributed. Thus, if the {\ttfamily Geom\+Object} is actually a {\ttfamily Mesh\+As\+Geom\+Object}, a compound {\ttfamily Geom\+Object} formed from a mesh of {\ttfamily Finite\+Elements}, then all the elements in the mesh, or all elements required to construct the mesh, must be retained as halo elements on every processor. This leads to a slight increase in the overall storage requirements (because none of the elements involved in the interaction are deleted when the problem is distributed) but it means that the entire {\ttfamily Geom\+Object} remains accessible to the fluid mesh without invoking MPI communications. Two functions can be used to specify that elements must be retained\+: ~\newline
~\newline

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Mesh::keep\_all\_elements\_as\_halos()}

\end{DoxyCode}
 ~\newline
keeps every element in the {\ttfamily Mesh} available to every processor, and 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{GeneralisedElement::must\_be\_kept\_as\_halo()}

\end{DoxyCode}
 ~\newline
can be called for a particular element to ensure that it is kept available to every processor.

We stress that the increase in storage requirements due to the retention of these elements is minimal because the ~\newline
 elements are only located along the (lower-\/dimensional) boundaries of the domain. For instance, in the \href{../../../interaction/fsi_collapsible_channel_algebraic/html/index.html}{\texttt{ collapsible channel problem}} the 1D mesh of beam elements bounds the 2D mesh of fluid elements; in \href{../../../interaction/turek_flag/html/index.html}{\texttt{ Turek and Hron\textquotesingle{}s FSI benchmark problem}}, the 2D fluid domain is bounded by a 1D mesh of {\ttfamily FSISolid\+Traction\+Elements}, and so on.

Examples of the implementation of these ideas are given for the ~\newline
 \href{../../fsi_channel_with_leaflet/html/index.html}{\texttt{ flow past an elastic leaflet}} and \href{../../turek_flag/html/index.html}{\texttt{ Turek and Hron\textquotesingle{}s FSI benchmark problem }}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} mirrors the MPI C bindings with the methods {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Helpers\+::init(...)} and {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Helpers\+::finalize()}; they call the methods {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Init(...)} and {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Finalize()} respectively. In addition, these methods automatically create (and destroy) a new instance of {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Comm} with the same set of processes as {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+COMM\+\_\+\+WORLD} but with a different communication context. This {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Comm} instance is accessible through {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Helpers\+::\+Communicator\+\_\+pt} which returns a pointer to an {\ttfamily Oomph\+Communicator} object.
\item An {\ttfamily Oomph\+Communicator} is {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib\textquotesingle{}s} object oriented wrapper to an {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Comm}.
\item Under normal operation, a user does not need to specify the {\ttfamily Oomph\+Communicator} for any object -- this is all handled automatically by {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib}. For example, on construction a {\ttfamily Problem} will use the {\ttfamily MPI\+\_\+\+Helpers} communicator; a {\ttfamily Linear\+Solver} will use the corresponding {\ttfamily Problem} communicator; and a {\ttfamily Preconditioner} will use the corresponding {\ttfamily Iterative\+Linear\+Solver} communicator.

Once a problem has been distributed, the function 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Problem::check\_halo\_schemes()}

\end{DoxyCode}
 can be called to check that the halo lookup schemes for each mesh are set up correctly.

Details about the mesh distribution can be generated by calling 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Mesh::doc\_mesh\_distribution(DocInfo\& doc\_info)}

\end{DoxyCode}
 which outputs the elements, nodes, halo(ed) elements, halo(ed) nodes, mesh, boundary elements and boundary nodes on each processor. This routine is automatically called when {\ttfamily Problem\+::distribute()} is called with a {\ttfamily Doc\+Info} object whose {\ttfamily Doc\+\_\+flag} is set to true (the default behaviour).

\hypertarget{index_parallel_debug}{}\doxysubsection{Debugging parallel code}\label{index_parallel_debug}
Parallel code can obviously fail in many more ways than a code that runs on a single processor. Here is a procedure that allows basic parallel debugging without requiring access to expensive commercial tools such as totalview, say. (The instructions below assume that you use \href{http://www.lam-mpi.org/}{\texttt{ LAM}} as your MPI installation; they can probably be modified to work with other versions of MPI, too).

Let\textquotesingle{}s assume you use \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/}{\texttt{ gdb}} as your debugger. To debug a serial code with \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/}{\texttt{ gdb}} you would load the executable {\ttfamily a.\+out} into the debugger using the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gdb ./a.out}

\end{DoxyCode}
 on the command line. Once inside \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/}{\texttt{ gdb}}, you run the code by typing \char`\"{}run\char`\"{}. If the code crashes, typing \char`\"{}where\char`\"{} will tell you in which line of the code the crash occurred, and it will also provide a traceback of the function calls that got you to this point.

To do this in parallel, we have to run each (parallel) instance of the code within its own \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/}{\texttt{ gdb}} session. To this, create the following three files\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A shell script {\ttfamily mpidbg} that must be executable, which contains\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mpirun \$1 \$2 -\/x DISPLAY rungdb.sh -\/x cmds.gdb}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item The executable file {\ttfamily rungdb.\+sh} must be in the same directory as {\ttfamily mpidbg} and contain the following 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{echo \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Running GDB on node `hostname`"{}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{echo \$DISPLAY}
\DoxyCodeLine{xterm -\/geometry 200x40 -\/e gdb \$*}
\DoxyCodeLine{exit 0}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Finally the {\ttfamily cmds.\+gdb} file should also be in the same directory and must contain the {\ttfamily run} command (so that all processors start their \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/}{\texttt{ gdb}} session simultaneously), and may also include other commands such as {\ttfamily set} {\ttfamily args} {\ttfamily command-\/line-\/arguments}, and so on.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Then, to run the debugger in parallel on 3 processors for the executable {\ttfamily a.\+out}, the command would be 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mpidbg -\/np 3 ./a.out }

\end{DoxyCode}
 Once the command is issued, an {\ttfamily xterm} window will be opened for each processor, and if a crash occurs on any processor, the usual \href{http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/}{\texttt{ gdb}} commands ({\ttfamily back}, {\ttfamily up}, {\ttfamily down}, {\ttfamily quit} and so on) may be used within any of the {\ttfamily xterm} sessions where a crash has taken place.
