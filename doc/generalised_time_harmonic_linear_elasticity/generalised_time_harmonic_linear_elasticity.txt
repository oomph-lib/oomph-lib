\mainpage The equations of time-harmonic linear elasticity and use of PMLs

The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate the solution of the
time-harmonic equations of linear elasticity in Cartesian
coordinates. These equations are useful to describe forced, time-harmonic
oscillations of elastic bodies.  The implementation extends
the standard formulation discussed in
<a href="../../time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/elastic_annulus/html/index.html">
another tutorial,</a>
which is modified to incorporate perfectly matched layers (PMLs) as an
alternative to classical absorbing/approximate boundary conditions or DtN maps.

We first present details on the relevant theory and its extensions and
proceed with an example problem of time-harmonic oscillations on an infinite
domain with an interior circular boundary.

\section theory Theory
Consider an infinite, linearly elastic body (of density \f$ \rho \f$, Young's
modulus \f$ E \f$ and Poisson's ratio \f$ \nu \f$), occupying 
the region \f$ D \f$
whose inner boundary is \f$ \partial D_d \f$.  Assuming that the body performs
time-harmonic oscillations of frequency of \f$ \omega \f$ 
its motion is governed by the equations of time-harmonic 
linear elasticity
<CENTER>
\f[
{\pmb{\nabla}^*}\cdot\pmb{\tau}^*+
\rho \pmb{F}^*={\rm -\rho\omega^2}\pmb{u}^*,
\f]
</CENTER> 
where the \f$ x_{i}^* \f$ are the Cartesian coordinates, and 
the time-periodic stresses, body force and displacements are given by 
\f$ {\rm Re}\{\pmb{\tau^*}(x_{i}^*){\rm e}^{-{\rm i}\omega
t^*}\} \f$, 
\f$ {\rm Re}\{\mathbf{F}^*(x_{i}^*){\rm e}^{-{\rm i}\omega
t^*}\} \f$ and \f$ {\rm Re}\{\mathbf{u}^*(x_{i}^*){\rm e}^{-{\rm i}\omega
t^*}\} \f$ respectively.  Note that, as usual, the superscript
asterisk notation is used to distinguish dimensional quantities
from their non-dimensional counterparts where required.

The body is subject to imposed time-harmonic displacements
\f$  {\rm Re}\{\mathbf{\hat{u}}^* {\rm e}^{-{\rm i}\omega
t^*}\} \f$
along  \f$ \partial D_d \f$. This requires that
<CENTER>
\f[
\mathbf{u}^*=\mathbf{\hat{u}}^*\,\,\textrm{on $
\partial D_d. $ }
\f]
</CENTER>

The stresses and displacements are related by the constitutive equations
<CENTER>
\f[
\pmb{\tau}^*=\frac{E}{1+\nu}\left(
\frac{\nu}{1-2\nu}(\pmb{\nabla}^*\cdot\mathbf{u}^*)\textbf{I}+
\frac{1}{2}(\pmb{\nabla}^*\mathbf{u}^*+(\pmb{\nabla}^*\mathbf{u}^*){{\rm T}})\right),
\f]
</CENTER>
where \f$ (\pmb{\nabla}^*\mathbf{u}^*)^{{\rm T}}
\f$ represents the transpose of \f$ \pmb{\nabla}^*\mathbf{u}^*.
\f$

We non-dimensionalise the equations, using a problem specific reference
length, \f$ {\cal L} \f$, and a timescale \f$ \displaystyle {\cal T}=\frac{1}{\omega} \f$, and  use
Young's modulus to non-dimensionalise the body force and the stress tensor:
<CENTER>
\f[
\pmb{\tau}^* = E \, \pmb{\tau}, \qquad
x_{i}^* = {\cal L}\, x_{i}
\f]
\f[
\mathbf{u}^* = {\cal L}\, \mathbf{u}, \qquad
\mathbf{F}^* = \frac{E}{\rho \cal L} \, \mathbf{F},
\qquad
t^* = {\cal T}\, t.
\f]
</CENTER>

The non-dimensional form of the equations is then given by
<CENTER>
\f[
\pmb{\nabla}\cdot\pmb{\tau}+\mathbf{F}=-\Omega^2\mathbf{u},
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[nondimeqn]@
\f]
</CENTER>
with the non-dimensional constitutive relation,
<CENTER>
\f[
\pmb{\tau}=\frac{1}{1+\nu}\left(
\frac{\nu}{1-2\nu}(\pmb{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{u})\textbf{I}+
\frac{1}{2}(\pmb{\nabla}\mathbf{u}+(\pmb{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^{{\rm T}})\right).
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[nondimconstitutive]@
\f]
</CENTER>
The non-dimensional parameter
<CENTER>
\f[
\Omega = {\cal L}\omega \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{E}}
\f]
</CENTER>
is the ratio of the elastic body's intrinsic timescale,
 \f$\displaystyle {\cal L} \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{E}}\f$, to the problem-specific 
timescale,\f$ \displaystyle {\cal T}=\frac{1}{\omega} \f$, that we 
used to non-dimensionalise time. \f$ \Omega \f$ can be interpreted as a
non-dimensional version of the excitation frequency; alternatively/equivalently 
\f$ \Omega^2 \f$ may be interpreted as a non-dimensional density.
The boundary conditions are set as
<CENTER>
\f[
\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{\hat{u}}\,\,\textrm{on $
\partial D_d $. }
\f]

\section pml Perfectly matched layers
The idea behind perfectly matched layers is illustrated in the
figure below. The actual physical/mathematical problem 
has to be solved in the infinite domain \f$ D \f$ (shown on the left), 
with a boundary condition at a certain distance 
from the source of the waves ensuring the suitable decay 
of the solution at large distances from the region of interest.

If computations are performed in a finite computational domain, \f$
D_c \f$ , (shown in the middle), spurious wave reflections are likely to  
be generated at the artificial boundary \f$
\partial D_c \f$ of the computational domain.

The idea behind PML methods is to surround the actual computational
domain \f$ D_c \f$ with a layer of "absorbing" material whose
properties are chosen such that the outgoing waves are absorbed 
within it, without creating any artificial reflected waves at the interface
between the PML layer and the computational domain.


@I w 0.75\textwidth pml "Sketch illustrating the idea behind perfectly matched layers. "

Our implementation of the perfectly matched layers follows the
development in 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999106004487">
A. Bermudez, L. Hervella-Nieto, A. Prieto, and 
R. Rodriguez "An optimal perfectly matched layer with unbounded 
absorbing function for time-harmonic acoustic scattering problems"
Journal of Computational Physics <b>223</b> 469-488 (2007)</a>
and we assume the boundaries of the computational domain to be aligned
with the coordinate axes, as shown in the sketch above.

The method requires a slight generalisation of the equations, 
achieved by introducing the complex coordinate mapping 
\f[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \to \frac{1}{\gamma_j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} 
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[cctransform]@
\f]
within the perfectly matched layers.

The choice of \f$ \gamma_j \f$  depends on the orientation of the 
PML layer. Since we are restricting ourselves to axis-aligned
mesh boundaries we need to distinguish three different cases, as 
shown in the sketch below:


@I w 0.75\textwidth PMLDomain  "Sketch illustrating the geometry of the perfectly matched layers. "

We follow the work of

- For layers that are aligned with the y axis (such as the left
  and right PML layers in the sketch, with vertical stripes) we set 
  \f[
  \gamma_{x}(x)  = 
  1 +i\frac{f_0}{a_0}\ \sigma_{x}(x) 
  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{ \ \ \ with \ \ \ }

  where \f$ a_0 = \sqrt{2.0(1.0+\nu)}\Omega\f$, \f$ f_0 \f$ is a
  constant to be tuned, \f$ X_{PML_{in}} \f$ is the x-coordinate
  of the inner boundary of the PML layer (the coordinate of the

  \f] 
- For layers that are aligned with the x axis  (such as the top

- In corner regions (diagonally striped) that are bounded by two
  axis-aligned PML layers (with outer coordinates \f$ X_{PML} \f$ and  
  \f$ Y_{PML} \f$) we set
  \f[

  \f]
- Finally, in the actual computational domain (outside
  the PML layers) we set
  \f[
  \gamma_{x}(x) =   \gamma_{y}(y) = 1.
  \f]
.

In our numerical experiments \f$ f_0 = 20.0 \f$ was found to be an 
appropriate value, which gives acceptable numerical behaviour.
This is well aligned with the cited paper, where this parameter
ranges from roughly \f$ 10.0 \f$ to \f$ 50.0 \f$.

\subsection impl Implementation of the perfectly matched layers within oomph-lib

The finite-element-discretised equations
(modified by the PML terms discussed above) are implemented in 
the \c GeneralisedTimeHarmonicLinearElasticityEquations<DIM> class which is templated
by the spatial dimension, \c DIM.  As usual, we provide 
fully functional elements by combining these with geometric
finite elements (from the Q and T families -- corresponding (in 2D)
to triangles and quad elements). By default, the PML modifications
are disabled, i.e.  \f$ \gamma_{x}(x) \f$ and \f$ \gamma_{y}(y) \f$ are both
set to 1.

  The generation of suitable 2D PML meshes along the axis-aligned
boundaries of a given bulk mesh is facilitated by helper
functions which automatically erect layers of (quadrilateral)
PML elements. The layers are built from 
\c QGeneralisedTimeHarmonicLinearElasticityElement<2,NNODE_1D> elements and
the parameter \c NNODE_1D is automatically chosen to match that of
the elements in the bulk mesh. The bulk mesh can contain quads or triangles
(as shown in the specific example presented below).

For instance, to erect a PML layer (of width \c width, with \c n_pml elements
across the width of the layer) on the "right" boundary 
(with boundary ID \c b_bulk) of the bulk mesh pointed to by \c
bulk_mesh_pt, a call to 
\code
  TwoDimensionalPMLHelper::create_right_pml_mesh
  <PMLLayerElement<ELASTICITY_ELEMENT> >
  (Solid_mesh_pt, right_boundary_id, 
  Global_Parameters::n_x_right_pml, 
  Global_Parameters::width_x_right_pml);
\endcode
returns a pointer to a newly-created mesh that contains the 
PML elements which are automatically attached to the 
boundary of the bulk mesh (i.e. the \c Nodes on the
outer boundary of the bulk mesh are shared (pointed to), rather than
duplicated, by the
elements in the PML mesh). The PML-ness of the elements is
automatically enabled, i.e. the functions \f$ \gamma_x(x) \f$
and \f$ \gamma_y(y) \f$ are set as described above. Finally,
zero Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the real and
imaginary parts of the solution on the outer boundary of the 
PML layer.

Similar helper functions exist for PML layers on other axis-aligned
boundaries, and for corner PML meshes; see the code listings
provided below. Currently, we only provide this functionality for 
convex 2D computational domains, but the generalisation to non-convex 
boundaries and 3D is straightforward (if tedious) to implement 
(Any volunteers?).

\section element_types Implementation 

Within \c oomph-lib, the non-dimensional version of equations 
(@R[nondimeqn]@) with 
the constitutive equations (@R[nondimconstitutive]@) are implemented 
in the \c GeneralisedTimeHarmonicLinearElasticityEquations<DIM> equations 
class, where the template parameter \c DIM indicates the spatial dimension. 
Following our usual approach, discussed in the
<A HREF="../../../doc/quick_guide/html/index.html"> (Not-So-)Quick
Guide,</A> this equation class is then combined with a geometric finite
element to form a fully-functional finite element. 
For instance, the combination of the 
\c GeneralisedTimeHarmonicLinearElasticityEquations<2>
class with the geometric finite element \c QElement<2,3> yields a nine-node 
quadrilateral element. As usual, the mapping 
between local and global (Eulerian) coordinates within an element is given by,
<CENTER>
\f[
x_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N^{(E)}} X^{(E)}_{ij} \, \psi_j, \qquad
i=1,2,
\f]
</CENTER> 
where \f$ N^{(E)} \f$ is the number of nodes in the element, \f$ X^{(E)}_{ij}
\f$ is the \f$ i \f$-th global (Eulerian) coordinate of 
the \f$ j \f$-th \c Node 
in the element, and the \f$ \psi_j \f$ are 
the element's shape functions, defined in the geometric
finite element. 

All the constitutive parameters are real. The two
components of the displacement field have a real and imaginary part.
We store the four real-valued nodal unknowns in the order
\f$ {\rm Re}\{u_x\}, {\rm Re}\{u_y\}, {\rm Im}\{u_x\}, {\rm Im}\{u_y\}
\f$ and use the shape functions to interpolate the displacements as
<CENTER>
\f[
u_i^{(n)} = \sum_{j=1}^{N^{(E)}} U^{(E)}_{ij} \, \psi_j, \qquad 
i=1,...4,
\f]
</CENTER>
where \f$  U^{(E)}_{ij} \f$  is the \f$ i \f$-th displacement component 
(enumerated as described above) at the \f$ j \f$-th \c Node in the element.

\section test A specific example: outward propagation of elastic waves from the surface of a cylindrical object

We consider the time-harmonic deformation of
a 2D elastic body that occupies the region outside 
a circle whose diameter we use as the lengthscale \f$ \cal L \f$.
 We impose a displacement \f$ {\mathbf{u}}(r,\theta)=
 u_0 {\mathbf{e}}_r + u_1 {\mathbf{e}}_{\theta} \f$ on the inner
 boundary (to generate a combination of pressure waves and shear waves) 
and allow for a formulation with perfectly matched layers on the outer
boundary of the computational domain, which should allow for a smooth propagation of the elastic
waves with no interference from the restriction of the problem to a
finite computational domain. \f$ {\mathbf{e}}_r \f$ is the unit
vector in the radial direction, whereas \f$ {\mathbf{e}}_{\theta} \f$
is the unit vector in azimuthal direction.

It is easy to find an analytical solution of this problem by working
in polar coordinates and exploiting the axisymmetry of the solution by
writing the displacements as
\f$ \displaystyle {\mathbf{u}} = U(r) {\mathbf{e}}_r \f$
or
\f$ \displaystyle {\mathbf{u}} = U(r) {\mathbf{e}}_{\theta} \f$. 
The displacement  \f$ U(r) \f$ is then governed in both cases by
an equation of type 
<CENTER>
\f[
\frac{d}{d r}\left(\frac{U}{r}+\frac{dU}{dr}\right) + k^2 U=0,
\f]
</CENTER>
where \f$ \displaystyle k^2 = k_{r}^2=
\frac{\Omega^2}{\lambda+2\mu}\f$ for the radial component and
\f$ \displaystyle k^2 = k_{\theta}^2=
\frac{\Omega^2}{\mu}\f$ for the azimuthal component. We also note that
<CENTER>
\f[
\lambda = \frac{\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)} \qquad \textrm{and} 
\qquad \mu = \frac{1}{2(1+\nu)}
\f]
</CENTER>
are the non-dimensional Lame parameters.
The solution of these equations is given in each case by:
<CENTER>
\f[
U(r) = H_1(kr).
\f]
</CENTER>
where \f$ H_1 \f$ is the Hankel function of first kind. 
The two solutions can then be converted to Cartesian coordinates and added
together in an appropriate manner.
The details of the procedure can be found in 
the <code> GlobalParameters::exact_u() </code> function.

We note that even though a relatively simple analytical solution
(in polar coordinates!) exists for this problem, it is a non-trivial
test case for our code which solves the governing equations in Cartesian
coordinates. It is also a highly relevant test case in the context of
testing perfectly matched layers, since the solution contains both
shear and compression waves.

\section results Results

The discretised
geometry is shown below. We choose a circle of radius \f$ r=0.5\f$ in
a computational domain otherwise set to \f$ -2 \le x \le 2, -2 \le y
\le 2 \f$, with a PML thickness of \f$ 1.6 \f$ in each dimension, spanned by \f$ 16 \f$ elements. 

@I w 0.6\textwidth mesh "Mesh used to resolve the geometry. "

The figures below show "carpet plots" (on the left) of the real and imaginary 
parts of the exact (green) and computed (blue) horizontal displacement 
for \f$ \Omega^2=30.0 \f$ and \f$ \nu=0.3 \f$. 
Comparing the two
solutions shows good agreement and hence an efficient damping
given by the perfectly matched layers. We can also observe this by
taking a one-dimensional slice from point \f$ (-2.0,0.0)\f$ to point
\f$ (2.0,0.0)\f$ and visualising the profiles of the exact and
computed solutions, shown on the right. The green line represents the
profile of the exact solution, whereas the blue dots are extracted
from the profile of the computed solution.

To demonstrate that the resulting displacement field is indeed
axisymmetric, we present plots of the real and imaginary parts of the radial
displacement, \f$ (Re(u_1)^2 + Re(u_2)^2)^{1/2} \f$ and \f$ (Im(u_1)^2
+ Im(u_2)^2)^{1/2} \f$.

\section comm_ex Comments and Exercises

\subsection comments Comments
- If you inspect the <A HREF="../../../demo_drivers/generalised_time_harmonic_linear_elasticity/time_harmonic_elasticity_driver.cc">driver code</a>
  you will notice that it also contains relevant code to perform 
  spatially adaptive simulations of the problem -- the adaptive
  version of the code is selected with \c \#ifdefs.

- The choice for the absorbing functions in our implementation of
the PMLs is not unique. There are alternatives varying in both order and
continuity properties. The current form is the result of several
feasibility studies and comparisons found in
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999106004487">
Bermudez et al.</a> For Helmholtz equations these damping functions produce an 
acceptable result in most practical situations without further 
modifications. For very specific applications, alternatives may 
need to be used and can easily be implemented within the
existing framework.

\subsection ex Exercises
\subsubsection pmlsize Changing perfectly matched layer parameters
Confirm that only a relatively small number of PML elements (across the thickness
of the PML layer) is required to effectively damp the outgoing waves.
It is also interesting to explore the effect of increasing the number
of elements of the mesh inside the perfectly matched layers.

Another parameter
that can be adjusted is the geometrical thickness of the perfectly matched
layers. In the case of linear elasticity (as opposed to for example
the Helmholtz equation), the thickness of these layers must be
relatively large to obtain the best results. Try to explain why and take
note of the differences between the two mentioned problems.

\subsubsection adaptivity Spatial adaptivity
The driver code discussed above already contains the straightforward
modifications required to enable spatial adaptivity. Explore this 
(by recompiling the code with -DADAPTIVE) and explain why spatial
adaptivity is not particularly helpful for the test problem
discussed above.

\subsubsection diff_order Linear and cubic finite elements
The driver code also contains (commented out) modifications
that allow the simulation to be performed with 
three-node (linear) and ten-node (cubic) triangles. Explore the
performance of these elements and confirm that the helper functions
correctly create matching (four-node and sixteen-node) quad elements 
in the PML layers.


\subsubsection default Default values for problem parameters
Following our usual convention, we provide default values
for problem parameters where this is sensible. 
Some parameters, such as the elasticity tensor, do need to be set since there are no obvious
defaults. If \c oomph-lib is compiled in \c PARANOID mode,
an error is thrown if the relevant pointers haven't been set. 
Without paranoia, you get a segmentation fault...

Confirm that this is the case by commenting out the relevant
assignments.

\subsubsection non_convex Non-convex PML boundaries
As discussed above, we currently provide helper functions to 
attach PML layers to axis-aligned boundaries of 2D meshes with
convex outer boundaries. Essentially, this restricts us to 
rectangular computational domains. Extend this capability by developing
methodologies to 
- deal with non-convex domain boundaries. We suggest you
  create PML meshes for the non-convex corners first, then
  create the axis-aligned meshes (note that these have to 
  share nodes with the already-created elements that occupy the
  non-convex corners), and then create the corner meshes
  for the convex corners (as before). When you're done, let
  us know -- this would be a really useful addition to
  oomph-lib's machinery. We're happy to help!
- Repeat the same exercise in 3D -- somewhat less trivial
  (so we're even keener for somebody to have a go!)
