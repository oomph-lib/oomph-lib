@I w 0.75\textwidth string "An elastic beam deforms under constant pressure loading. The midpoint of the beam has moved from point D to point E."

In the limit of large initial pre-stress, bending effects may be
neglected and the beam behaves as though it were an elastic
string of undeformed length \f$L\f$, for which an exact solution may
be found.
Under the action of a constant external pressure, \f$ P\f$, 
the stress will be uniform along the string, leading to a uniform
tension, \f$T\f$, and the shape is 
an arc of a circle with radius \f$R\f$, see the above Figure.
A simple force balance shows that \f$ P = -T/R \f$.

 We use geometrical arguments to calculate the radius of the circle,
 \f$ R = 2\sin\alpha/L \f$; 
 the iscoceles triangle \f$ACE\f$ may be used to determine the angle
 \f$\alpha = \pi - 2\beta\f$. It follows that
 \f[\tan\alpha = \tan(\pi -
 2\beta) = - \tan 2\beta = \frac{2\tan\beta}{\tan^{2}\beta -1}, \f]
 where \f$\tan\beta
 = 2d/L\f$ and \f$d\f$ is the vertical displacement of the
 mid-point of the beam. 
 The stress is calculated using Hooke's law and the tension is
 the stress multiplied by the width of the beam:
\f[ T = \sigma_{0} \frac{h}{R_{0}} \frac{2\alpha R}{L}, \f]
 and so
 \f[ P = - T/R = \sigma_{0} \frac{h}{R_{0}} \frac{2\alpha}{L} \f]
 
 We shall solve the above problem numerically using \c oomph-lib's
 KirchhoffBeamElements, which include both stretching and bending effects.
 In the standard formulation, the displacments are unknowns and the
 external pressure, \f$P\f$, is prescribed in a load function. In an
 alternative, displacement-control, formulation, the
 displacements at a particular position is prescribed and 
 the pressure becomes an unknown. Displacement control is often 
 essential problems in which buckling occurs through a sub-critical 
 bifurcation. The driver code 
 <A HREF="../../../../demo_drivers/beam/tensioned_string/tensioned_string.cc">
 tensioned_string.cc</A> is written so that either the 
 external pressure, \f$P\f$, or the mid-point displacement, \f$d\f$, may be 
 a prescribed control parameter.

\section global Global parameters and functions
The namespace \c ConstPressureForBeam contains the dimensionless beam
thickness, \f$ h/R_{0}\f$, the dimensionless pre-stress,
\f$\sigma_{0}\f$, a pointer to the pressure load, \f$P\f$, and a
variable that will be used to specify the prescribed position of the
mid-point displacement, \f$d\f$. The namespace
also contains the function \c ConstPressureForBeam::load() which returns a constant
pressure load of mangnitude \f$P\f$.

\section main The driver code

The main code is again very short. The physical parameters
\f$h/R_{0}\f$, \f$\sigma_{0}\f$ and \f$L\f$ are initialised and the
problem is constructed using 10 elements. The final argument of the 
ElasticBeamProblem constructor is a boolean: if true, the mid-point
displacement will be the control parameter, if false, the external
pressure will be the control parameter.
The final call is to the function ElasticBeamProblem::parameter_study().

\section problem The problem class

The problem class has six member functions, only two of which are
non-trvial:
 - the constructor \ref constructor
 - the function \c parameter_study(), described in \ref param
.

 In the present problem, the functions 
\c Problem::actions_before_newton_solve() and \c
Problem::actions_after_newton_solve() are not required, so remain
empty. The function 
\c ElasticBeamProblem::mesh_pt() overloads the
(virtual) function \c Problem::mesh_pt() to return a pointer
to the specific mesh used in this problem, which avoids explicit re-casts
when member functions of the 
specific mesh need to be accessed. The final function 
\c ElasticBeamProblem::pext() returns a pointer to the external
pressure, which is stored in a global Data object, 
because it may be a variable in the problem.

 The class also includes private data members: three used for displacement
 control; a pointer to a GeomObject that represents the beam's
 undeformed geometry; and a double that stores the undeformed length
 of the beam.

\section constructor The Problem constructor
We start by creating the undeformed midplane of the beam a
StraightLine (one of \c oomph-lib's standard geometric objects). 

\skipline start_of_constructor   
\until Undef_beam_pt

 We then construct the a one-dimensional Lagrangian mesh in
 two-dimensional space, using the previously-constructed geometric
 object to set the initial positions of the nodes. 
 \skipline Create
 \until OneDLagrangianMesh

 Next we pin the nodal positions on all boundaries

\skipline Set the 
\until }

 The next task is to allocate memory for the external pressure, which
 is stored in a global data object
 \skipline The external
 \until ConstPressureForBeam

 We then loop over the elements, setting the physical parameters, the
 load, the undeformed surface and the external pressure (if
 displacement control is to be used).
 \skipline Loop
 \until end of loop over elements

 We choose an element, and local position therein, at which the
 displacement is to be monitored.
 \skipline Establish
 \until S_displ_control[0]

 If we are using displacement control, the pressure is not a degree of
 freedom, so must be unpinned and the displacment must be fixed at the
 chosen position in our chosen element. We must also pass a pointer to
 the variable that stores the desired displacment to the element
 \skipline Unpin
 \until fix_displ
 \skip ,1) 
 \skip endl
 \until Midpoint_position 

 If we are not using displacement control, then the pressure is not a
 variable in the problem and must be pinned
 \skipline Pin
 \until Global
 
 Finally, we assign the equation numbers
 \skipline Assign
 \until cout

\section param The Parameter Study

 The function ElasticBeamProblem::parameter_study() is used to run a
 parameter study using either the external pressure or the mid-point 
 displacement as the control parameter. During the solution of this
 particular problem, the maximum residual can be greater than the
 default maximum value of 10.0. The maximum permitted value of the
 residuals is increased by changing the protected member data 
 Problem::Max_residuals.

 Next, we choose values of the increments in the control parameters,
 set their initial values and open an output file that will contain
 the value of the external pressure, the mid-point displacement and
 external pressure computed from the analytic solution for each value
 of the control parameter. We also create an output stream and string
 that will be used to write the complete solution at each parameter
 value.

 In the loop, we increment the control parameter (either Pext, or
 Midpoint_position), solve the problem, calculate the exact pressure,
 save the solution and write the pressure, control position and exact
 pressure to the trace file.

-# Modify the code so that pressure is the control parameter. What do
   you notice? What is the convention for calculating the normal direction?

-# Modify the code so that one end of the beam is no longer fixed in
