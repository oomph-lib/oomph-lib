class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1Tree}{oomph\+::\+Tree}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A generalised tree base class that abstracts the common functionality between the quad-\/ and octrees used in mesh adaptation in two and three dimensions, respectively. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1TreeRoot}{oomph\+::\+Tree\+Root}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em \doxylink{classoomph_1_1TreeRoot}{Tree\+Root} is a \doxylink{classoomph_1_1Tree}{Tree} that forms the root of a (recursive) tree. The "{}root node"{} is special as it holds additional information about its neighbours and their relative rotation (inside a \doxylink{classoomph_1_1TreeForest}{Tree\+Forest}). \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{classoomph_1_1TreeForest}{oomph\+::\+Tree\+Forest}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A \doxylink{classoomph_1_1TreeForest}{Tree\+Forest} consists of a collection of Tree\+Roots. Each member tree can have neighbours in various enumerated directions (e.\+g. S/\+W/\+N/E for a \doxylink{classoomph_1_1QuadTreeForest}{Quad\+Tree\+Forest}) and the orientation of their compasses can differ, allowing for complex, unstructured meshes. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
