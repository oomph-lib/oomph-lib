\label{classoomph_1_1ShapeWithDeepCopy}\index{oomph::ShapeWithDeepCopy@{oomph::ShapeWithDeepCopy}}


A shape function with a deep copy constructor. This allows for use with stl operations (e.\+g. manipulating vectors of shape functions). A seperate class is needed because the basic shape function uses a shallow copy.
