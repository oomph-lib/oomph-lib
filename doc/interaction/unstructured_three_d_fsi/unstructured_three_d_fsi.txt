\mainpage Demo problem: 3D FSI on unstructured meshes


This tutorial demonstrates the use of unstructured meshes
in 3D fluid-structure interaction problems. We combine two 
single-physics problems, namely
- <a href="../../../solid/unstructured_three_d_solid/html/index.html">
  Large deformations of an elastic 3D bifurcating tube, loaded
  by an internal pressure</a>
  \n\n
- <a href="../../../navier_stokes/unstructured_three_d_fluid/html/index.html">
  Flow through a rigid 3D bifurcating tube</a>
.
for which we have already created unstructured 3D meshes, 
using <A HREF="http://www.wias-berlin.de/~si ">Hang Si's</A>
open-source mesh generator  <A HREF="http://tetgen.berlios.de/"> \c tetgen </A>.

\section the_problem The problem
The two figures below show a sketch of the problem. An applied pressure
drop drives fluid through an elastic, bifurcating tube whose
branches have approximately rectangular cross-sections. We solve this
problem as a fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction problem
in which the fluid provides the traction onto the solid whose
deformation changes the fluid domain. 



@I w 0.75\textwidth problem_sketch_forward "Sketch of the problem. "

@I w 0.75\textwidth problem_sketch_backward "Sketch of the problem (reverse view). "


As usual, we formulate the problem in non-dimensional form. For this
purpose we non-dimensionalise all lengths on the half-width, \f$ W
\f$, of the square inflow cross-section, and use the overall pressure drop,
\f$ \Delta P^* = P_{in}^* - P_{out}^* \f$ to define the (viscous) 
velocity scale 
\f[
{\cal U} = \frac{\Delta P^*\  W}{\mu}.
\f] 
With this choice the Reynolds number becomes
\f[
Re = \frac{\rho {\cal U} W }{\mu} = \frac{ \Delta P^* \rho W^2 }{\mu^2},
\f]
and we choose to drive the flow by a dimensionless pressure drop of
\f$ \Delta P = 1. \f$ Using this non-dimensionalisation an 
increase in the Reynolds number may be interpreted as in increase 
in the applied (dimensional) pressure drop along the vessel. Note that
all pressures are defined relative to an external pressure, which we set
to zero.

We assume that the solid's constitutive equation is given by
\c oomph-lib's generalised Hookean constitutive law and
non-dimensionalise the solid-mechanics stresses and tractions
with the Young's modulus \f$ E \f$. 

The FSI interaction parameter \f$ Q, \f$ which represents the ratio
of the (viscous) fluid stress scale to the reference stress used
to non-dimensionalise the solid stresses, is therefore given by
\f[
Q = \frac{\mu {\cal U}}{{\cal L} E} = \frac{\Delta P^*}{E} \ . 
\f]

\section results Results
The animation below illustrates the system's behaviour in a parameter
study in which we keep the Reynolds number fixed at \f$ Re=100 \f$
while increasing the FSI parameter \f$ Q \f$ in small increments. 
The increase in  \f$ Q \f$ may be interpreted as a reduction in the
tube's stiffness and the animation shows clearly how this increases 
the flow-induced deformation: the upstream end bulges and
the downstream end is compressed.

\section overview_implementation Overview of the implementation

The general procedure described below is essentially the same as
that discussed in the <a href="../../unstructured_fsi/html/index.html">
two-dimensional unstructured FSI tutorial. </a>  The use of 
an unstructured mesh 
means that the most convenient node-update strategy for the fluid mesh
is to treat it as a pseudo-elastic solid. Nonetheless,
the majority of the steps described below are the same as for
other fluid-structure-interaction problems.

 We reiterate that an
 important prerequisite for the use of the automatic \c
 FSI_functions is that each boundary between fluid and solid
 meshes must be parametrised by boundary coordinates. Moreover, the
 boundary-coordinate representations <b> must </b> be the same in both
 the fluid and solid meshes. This use of a continuous-coordinate 
 representation of the boundaries means that the fluid and solid
 meshes do not need to match at the boundaries; see the section \ref
 matching_fluid_and_solid. Unfortunately, the construction of a global
 surface parametrisation of a general surface is a non-trivial
 problem. We side-step this problem by making use of the fact that any
 third-party tetrahedral mesh generator represents domain
 boundaries using a surface triangulation, or planar
 surface facets. As the mesh is
 imported into \c oomph-lib, each surface facet is treated as a
 separate boundary and given a unique boundary identifier. The surface
 parametrisation of each facet is then simply 
 given by local coordinates of the plane; see \ref boundary_coord.
 A consequence of this
 approach is that the physical boundaries will consist of several
 mesh "boundaries", as already discussed in the single-physics problems.

Since the driver code, discussed in detail below, is somewhat lengthy
(partly because of the large number of self-tests and diagnostics
included), we provide a brief overview of the main steps
required to solve this problem:
\n\n
-# Use the unstructured 3D mesh generator <A HREF="http://tetgen.berlios.de/">
   \c tetgen </A> to generate the solid mesh, using the procedure discussed in 
   <a href="../../../solid/unstructured_three_d_solid/html/index.html#mesh">
   another tutorial.</a>
   \n\n
-# Use the same procedure to generate the fluid mesh, as discussed in 
   <a href="../../../navier_stokes/unstructured_three_d_fluid/html/index.html#mesh">
   the single-physics fluids tutorial.</a> Make sure that the 
   fluid mesh is derived from the \c SolidMesh base class to allow the use of
   pseudo-elasticity to update the nodal positions in response
   to the deformation of the domain boundary.
   \n\n
-# Ensure that boundary coordinates are set up (consistently) on the 
   FSI interface between the two meshes. For meshes derived from 
   \c oomph-lib's \c TetgenMesh class, this may be done 
   by calling the function \c
   TetgenMesh::setup_boundary_coordinates(); see the section
   \ref boundary_coord for details.
   \n\n
-# Attach \c FSISolidTractionElements to the faces of the "bulk"
   solid elements that are exposed to the fluid flow. These
   elements will apply the fluid traction to the solid.
   \n\n
-# Combine the \c FSISolidTractionElements to a compound \c GeomObject
   that provides a continuous representation of the solid's FSI 
   boundary, required by the \c
   ImposeDisplacementByLagrangeMultiplierElements described below.
   \n\n
-# Attach  \c ImposeDisplacementByLagrangeMultiplierElements to the
   faces of the "bulk" fluid elements that are adjacent to the
   solid. These elements will employ Lagrange multipliers
   to deform the pseudo-solid fluid mesh so that its shape remains
   consistent with the motion of the solid's FSI boundary
   (as described by the compound \c GeomObject created in the previous
   step).
   \n\n
-# Determine the "bulk" fluid elements that are adjacent to the
   integration points of the  \c FSISolidTractionElements,
   using the function \c
   FSI_functions::setup_fluid_load_info_for_solid_elements(...).
   \n\n
.

In our experience, just as in two-dimensions, 
the most error-prone part of this procedure is the
identification of the mesh boundaries. In particular, if the
description of the FSI interface as viewed from the fluid and solid
meshes is inconsistent, the automatic matching of the unstructured 
fluid and solid meshes will not work (see \ref boundary_coord for details). For 
this reason, the driver code presented below generates a lot of 
output that can be used to identify and fix such problems. 
See also the section \ref go_wrong at the end of this tutorial.

\section namespace Problem Parameters
As usual we define the various problem parameters in a 
global namespace. We define the Reynolds number, \f$ Re \f$, and
the FSI interaction parameter \f$ Q \f$.

\dontinclude unstructured_three_d_fsi.cc
\skipline start_of_namespace
\until Q=

We provide a pointer to the constitutive equation for the
solid. For simplicity, the same constitutive equation will also be used for 
the (pseudo-)solid elements that determine the deformation of 
the fluid mesh. In general, of course, a different constitutive
equation can (and probably should) be used to control the mesh motion.

\until Nu=

Finally, we define the tractions that act on the fluid
at the in- and outflow cross-sections. We enforce the non-dimensional 
pressure drop of \f$ \Delta P = 1\f$ (on the viscous scale) by 
setting \f$ P_{in} = -P_{out}=0.5 \f$, thus pressurising the tube's 
upstream end  while applying an equal and opposite "suction" 
downstream. (Note that in the  
<a href="../../../navier_stokes/unstructured_three_d_fluid/html/index.html">
corresponding single-physics fluids problem</a> the actual pressure
values were irrelevant because the vessel walls were rigid. 
In the FSI problem considered here it obviously makes a big difference 
if the fluid pressure is positive or negative because the external
reference pressure is set to zero.)

\section mesh_code Creating the meshes

\subsection solid_mesh The solid mesh
Following the procedure discussed in the 
<a href="../../../solid/unstructured_three_d_solid/html/index.html">
single-physics solid mechanics problem</a> we create the mesh
for the elastic tube using multiple inheritance 
from \c oomph-lib's \c TetgenMesh and the \c SolidMesh base
class.

\dontinclude unstructured_three_d_fsi.cc
\skipline start_solid_mesh
\until {

As before, we set the Lagrangian coordinates to the current
nodal positions to make the initial configuration stress-free. 
Next, we identify the elements next to the various boundaries
(<a href="../../../solid/unstructured_three_d_solid/html/index.html">recall
</a> that the domain boundaries are specified in the tetgen 
<code>*.poly</code> file), and set up the boundary
coordinates. Adopting our usual state of continuous paranoia, we document these
elements to facilitate debugging; see the 
section \ref boundary_coord for details.

\until };


<HR>




\subsection fluid_mesh The fluid mesh
The creation of the fluid mesh follows the same process but uses
the mesh created for the  
<a href="../../../navier_stokes/unstructured_three_d_fluid/html/index.html">
single-physics fluids problem.</a>
The use of multiple inheritance from the \c TetgenMesh and \c SolidMesh base
classes is required to use pseudo-solid node-update techniques 
to move the fluid nodes in response to changes 
in the domain boundary. We refer to the 
<a href="../../../navier_stokes/unstructured_three_d_fluid/html/index.html">
fluids tutorial</a> for a discussion of the \c split_corner_elements flag.


\skipline start_fluid_mesh
\until setup_boundary_element_info()

We create boundary coordinates along all mesh boundaries. To ensure
that fluid and solid boundary coordinates are aligned properly,
we use the flag \c switch_normal to change the direction of the 
normal vector for the fluid mesh; see \ref boundary_coord for details.


\until };



<HR>
<HR>


\section main The driver code

We specify an output directory and instantiate the constitutive 
equation (\c oomph-lib's generalisation of Hooke's law), specifying a 
Poisson ratio of 0.3. As discussed above, 
this constitutive equation will be used for the
"proper" solid mechanics that determines the deformation of 
the elastic vessel walls, and for the pseudo-solid that determines 
the deformation of the fluid mesh. 


\dontinclude unstructured_three_d_fsi.cc
\skipline start_of_main
\until Nu);

We create the \c Problem object and output the initial guess 
for the solution.

\until ()++;

Finally, we perform a parameter study in which we compute the
solution of the fully-coupled FSI problem for increasing 
values of the FSI parameter \f$ Q \f$ -- physically, an increase
in \f$ Q \f$ can be interpreted as a reduction in the
stiffness of the tube walls while keeping the fluid 
properties and the driving pressure drop constant.


\until end_of_main


<HR>
<HR>

\section class The Problem class
The \c Problem class has the usual members,
with access functions to the fluid and solid meshes,
and a post-processing routine.


\dontinclude unstructured_three_d_fsi.cc
\skipline start_of_problem_class
\until doc_solution

We provide several helper functions to create the 
\c FaceElements that (i) apply the applied traction on the fluid
at the in- and outflow cross-sections; (ii) apply the fluid traction onto 
the solid, and (iii) create the Lagrange multipliers that
apply the solid displacement onto the pseudo-solid fluid mesh.

\until create_lagrange


We also provide a helper function that documents the boundary coordinates
on the solid mesh.  

\until doc_solid_boundary_coordinates(

Finally we provide a large number of additional helper functions that
specify the various mesh boundaries (as 
defined in the tetgen <code>*.poly</code> file) that make up 
the physical boundaries of interest: the in- and outflow boundaries 
in the fluid domain; the FSI boundaries of the fluid and solid domains 
and the boundaries along which the tube wall is held in a fixed position.


\until end npinned_solid_boundary

The private member data includes pointers to the various
meshes and the \c GeomObject representation of the FSI boundary
(created from the \c FaceElements attached to the solid mesh).

\until Solid_fsi_boundary_pt;

Finally, here are the vectors that store the mesh boundary IDs 
associated with the various domain boundaries of interest.

\until };





<HR>
<HR>

\section constructor The Problem constructor

We start by building the fluid mesh, using the files created
by <A HREF="http://tetgen.berlios.de/"> \c tetgen </A>; see the 
discussion in the corresponding 
<a href="../../../navier_stokes/unstructured_three_d_fluid/html/index.html#mesh">
single-physics fluids problem.</a>


\skipline start_of_constructor
\until split_corner_elements);
 

Next we associated the \c tetgen boundary IDs with the various
boundaries of interest: The inflow boundary is represented by 
\c tetgen boundary 0, and the two outflow boundaries
have IDs 1 and 2. 

\until Outflow_boundary_id[1]=2;

The FSI boundary (i.e. the boundary of the fluid mesh that is
exposed to the elastic vessel wall) comprises 12 separate
tetgen facets which were numbered 3 to 14 in the <code>*.poly</code> 
that describes the fluid mesh. 

\until }
  

Next, we create the solid mesh, using the files created
by <A HREF="http://tetgen.berlios.de/"> \c tetgen </A>; 
see the discussion in the corresponding
<a href="../../../solid/unstructured_three_d_solid/html/index.html#mesh">
single-physics solids problem.</a>

\skipline Define solid mesh and its
\until face_file_name);

Following the procedure used for the fluid mesh, we identify the 
mesh boundaries that make up the (pinned) ends of the tube
(boundaries 0, 1 and 2, as defined in the tetgen <code>*.poly</code>
file) and the FSI boundary (boundaries 3 to 14 -- note that this enumeration
matches that in the fluid mesh; see \ref boundary_coord
for further details of how the fluid and solid meshes are matched). 


\until }

We create the fluid traction elements that impose
the applied pressures in the in- and outflow cross-sections.

\until create_fluid_traction_elements();


Next, we create the \c FaceElements that apply the fluid traction
to the solid,

\until create_fsi_traction_elements();

and the \c FaceElements that use Lagrange multipliers to deform
the fluid mesh to keep it aligned with the FSI boundary.

\until create_lagrange_multiplier_elements();

We combine the various sub-meshes to a global mesh.

\until build_global_mesh();


Next, we apply the boundary conditions for the fluid mesh:
We impose parallel in- and outflow at the in- and outflow
boundaries and apply boundary conditions
for the pseudo-elastic deformation of the fluid mesh. Since
the in- and outflow cross-sections of the elastic tube are
held in place, we pin the position of the fluid nodes
in these cross-sections too. To facilitate debugging we 
document the position of the fluid nodes whose 
(pseudo-solid) displacements we suppressed.

\until pseudo_solid_bc_file.close();

We apply the no-slip condition on the fluid nodes
that are located on the FSI boundary. In addition, we 
apply boundary conditions for the Lagrange multipliers.
We pin the Lagrange multipliers for nodes that are located on 
the in- and outflow boundaries where the nodal positions are 
pinned.  <a href="../../../solid/prescribed_displ_lagr_mult/html/index.html">
Recall</a> that the Lagrange multipliers are additional degrees of
freedom that are added to the "bulk" degrees of freedom that were
originally created by the "bulk" element. 
The storage for the 
Lagrange multipliers is added to the Nodes by the FaceElements and
the values at which the Lagrange multipliers are stored are found
using the function 
\c BoundaryNodeBase::index_of_first_value_assigned_by_face_element().
The documentation of the position of
the pinned Lagrange multiplier nodes in 
\c RESLT/pinned_lagrange_multiplier_nodes.dat is here to
facilitate the debugging of the code and is highly recommended.


\until pinned_file.close();

We complete the build of the fluid elements by specifying
the Reynolds number and the constitutive equation for the 
pseudo-solid equations; recall that we use the same constitutive 
equation as used for the tube wall.

\until }


We apply the "solid" boundary conditions by 
pinning the positions of the nodes that are located at the
ends of the elastic tube, and, just to be on the safe side,
document their positions to allow for debugging and sanity-checking.

\until bc_file.close();


We complete the build of the solid elements by passing the pointer
to the constitutive equation.


\until }

Finally, we set up the fluid-structure interaction by determining
which "bulk" fluid elements are located next to the FSI traction elements
that apply the fluid load to the solid. This must be done separately for
each of the mesh boundaries that make up the physical FSI boundary. 
To facilitate debugging,  we document the boundary 
coordinates along the FSI interface (as seen by the fluid) by opening 
the  \c Multi_domain_functions::Doc_boundary_coordinate_file stream before
calling  \c
FSI_functions::setup_fluid_load_info_for_solid_elements(...).
If this stream is open, the setup routine writes the Eulerian 
coordinates of the points on the FSI interface and their 
intrinsic surface coordinate \f$ [ x, y, z, \zeta_1, \zeta_2  ] \f$ 
to the specified file. This may be compared against the corresponding data for
the solid's view of the FSI interface, documented in 
\c doc_solid_boundary_coordinates().


\until }


All that's now left to do is to set up the equation numbering scheme and 
the problem is ready to be solved.


\until }

<HR>
<HR>



\section fsi_traction Creating the FSI traction elements
The creation of the FSI traction elements that apply the 
fluid traction to the solid elements that are adjacent to the
FSI boundary follows the usual procedure: We loop over the
relevant 3D "bulk" solid elements and attach the 
\c FSISolidTractionElements to the appropriate faces. 

\skipline start_of_create_fsi_traction_elements
\until new FSISolidTractionElement<SOLID_ELEMENT,3>(bulk_elem_pt,face_index);

Next we add the newly-created \c FaceElement to the mesh of traction
elements, specify which boundary of the bulk mesh it is attached to,
and pass the FSI interaction parameter \f$ Q \f$ to the element. 

\until  end of create_fsi_traction_elements


<HR>
<HR>


\section create_lagr Creating the Lagrange multiplier elements
The creation of the \c FaceElements that use Lagrange multipliers
to impose the boundary displacement of the pseudo-solid fluid mesh
is again fairly straightforward (the use of Lagrange multipliers
for the imposition of boundary displacements is explained
in <a href="../../../solid/prescribed_displ_lagr_mult/html/index.html">
another tutorial</a>). The only complication is that we must loop over
the different parts of the FSI boundary. In each case we 
combine the \c FSISolidTractionElements attached to the
solid mesh into a compound \c GeomObject. Each \c GeomObject
provides a continuous representation of the relevant part of the 
FSI boundary, parametrised by the boundary coordinate assigned 
earlier while its shape is determined by the deformation of 
the 3D solid elements that the \c FSISolidTractionElements are
attached to.

\until (Solid_fsi_traction_mesh_pt[i]);

Having represented the boundary by a (compound) \c GeomObject,
we now attach \c ImposeDisplacementByLagrangeMultiplierElements
to the appropriate faces of the "bulk" fluid elements that are 
adjacent to the FSI interface and add them to their own mesh:

\until add_element_pt

Finally, we pass a pointer to the compound \c GeomObject that defines
the shape of the FSI interface and specify which boundary in the
"bulk" fluid mesh the \c ImposeDisplacementByLagrangeMultiplierElement
is attached to.

\until end of create_lagrange_multiplier_elements

<HR>
<HR>

\section fluid_traction Attaching the fluid traction elements
The helper function \c create_fluid_traction_elements() 
attaches \c  NavierStokesTractionElements to the in- and outflow
cross-sections of the fluid mesh and thus imposes the
prescribed pressure drop onto the fluid.


\skipline start_of_fluid_traction_elements
\until end of create_traction_elements


<HR>
<HR>

\section doc_solution Post-processing
The post-processing routine simply executes the output functions for 
the fluid and solid meshes and documents their mesh boundaries. We 
also document the FSI traction that the fluid exerts onto the solid.

\skipline start_of_doc_solution
\until end_of_doc


<HR>
<HR>

\section doc_solid_zeta Sanity check: Documenting the solid boundary coordinates
The function \c doc_solid_boundary_coordinates() 
documents the parametrisation of the
solid's FSI boundary by writing into a file the solid's 
counterpart of the \f$ [ x, y, z, \zeta_1, \zeta_2 ] \f$ data 
that we created for the fluid side of the FSI interface
when setting up the fluid-structure interaction with 
\c FSI_functions::setup_fluid_load_info_for_solid_elements(...).
The two parametrisations should be consistent; see
\ref go_wrong for more details. The implementation is straightforward
and is suppressed for brevity; see the 
<a href=
"../../../../demo_drivers/interaction/unstructured_three_d_fsi/unstructured_three_d_fsi.cc">
source code </a> if you want to know
how it works.

\section comm_ex Comments and Exercises

\subsection boundary_coord How the boundary coordinates are generated

The use of pseudo-elasticity for the node update in the fluid mesh 
makes the solution of FSI problems extremely straightforward. 
They key feature that allows the "automatic" coupling of the 
unstructured fluid and solid meshes is the (consistent!) generation 
of the boundary coordinates  \f$ (\zeta_1,\zeta_2) \f$ along 
the FSI interface. For reasons already mentioned, the procedure is more
involved than in the equivalent two-dimensional problem.
The implementation of this functionality in 
\c TetgenMesh::setup_boundary_coordinates(...) exploits the 
fact that
-# Meshes generated
   by  <A HREF="http://tetgen.berlios.de/"> \c tetgen </A>
   are bounded by planar facets, and \n\n
-# We insist that all facets are given distinct boundary IDs  
   when defining the domain in the tetgen <code>*.poly</code> file. 
.

  The figure below illustrates the generation of the boundary 
coordinates within a representative planar facet (shown in cyan) 
that defines a particular mesh boundary. 

@I w 0.75\textwidth boundary_coords_with_mesh "Sketch illustrating the generation of boundary coordinates on a mesh boundary that is defined by a planar facet (shown in cyan). "


Here is how we generate the boundary coordinates:

-# We start by attaching \c FaceElements to the appropriate faces of 
   the "bulk" elements that are adjacent to the mesh boundary defined
   by the facet. These \c FaceElements provide a surface triangulation 
   of the boundary. In the sketch above, the surface triangulation
   is represented by the blue surface mesh. \n\n
-# We locate the "lower left" and "upper right" nodes
   within the surface mesh, based on a lexicographical 
   ordering of the nodes' 3D coordinates. \n\n
-# The straight line from the "lower left" to the "upper right"
   node (shown by the dashed red line) defines a direction that 
   is co-planar with the facet and therefore allows us to define 
   an in-plane unit vector, \f$ {\bf T}_1\f$, shown in red. \n\n
-# A second in-plane unit vector, \f$ {\bf T}_2\f$ 
   (shown in yellow), can then be constructed by taking the cross-product
   of \f$ {\bf T}_1\f$ and the outer unit normal \f$ {\bf N} \f$.
   (The outer unit normal can be obtained from any of the adjacent 
   bulk elements.) \n\n
-# The orthonormal in-plane vectors \f$ {\bf T}_1\f$ and \f$ {\bf T}_2\f$ 
   define a unique parametrisation of the boundary in terms of 
   the boundary coordinates \f$ (\zeta_1,\zeta_2) \f$, if we 
   insist that for every point on the boundary we have
   \f[
   {\bf R}(\zeta_1,\zeta_2) = {\bf R}_{\mbox{lower left}} + 
   \zeta_1 {\bf T}_1 + \zeta_2 {\bf T}_2.
   \f]
   This allows the assignment of boundary coordinates for each
   of the nodes on this boundary. \n\n
-# Once this is done we can delete the \c FaceElements that defined
   the surface triangulation. \n\n
.

Since the generation of the boundary coordinates by the above
procedure only relies on the position of the "lower left" and 
"upper right" vertices (which are
properties of the facet rather than the \c tetgen mesh) the
boundary coordinates are unique, regardless of the actual
discretisation generated by \c tetgen. Furthermore, 
the boundary coordinates created from the fluid and solid meshes
will be consistent \e provided we reverse the direction of the outer
unit normal in one of the meshes. This is exactly what the
\c switch_normal flag in \c TetgenMesh::setup_boundary_coordinates(...)
is for. When generating the boundary coordinates for 
our problem, we switched the direction of the normal
in the fluid mesh;  see the section \ref fluid_mesh, above.

Here is an animation of the automatically-generated boundary
coordinates along the 12 mesh boundaries that constitute the
FSI boundary, when viewed from the fluid and the solid, respectively.
In each of the frames the contours indicate the value of  
\f$ \zeta_1 \f$ within the respective boundary. Note that the
boundary coordinates established in the two meshes match, even 
though the discretisations do not.



@I w 0.75\textwidth fluid_boundary_test "Contour plot of the automatically-generated boundary coordinates on the FSI boundary, viewed from the fluid mesh. "


@I w 0.75\textwidth solid_boundary_test "Contour plot of the automatically-generated boundary coordinates on the FSI boundary, viewed from the solid mesh. "


You should explore this procedure yourself as an \b exercise: For
instance you may want to explore what happens
if you don't switch the direction of the normal in the fluid mesh when 
generating the boundary coordinates.

\subsection matching_fluid_and_solid Fluid and solid meshes do not have to be matching
The mesh shown in the problem sketch at the beginning of this 
tutorial already suggested that the fluid and solid meshes do not have to 
match across the FSI interface. To illustrate this point more clearly, here 
is the result of another computation for which we generated 
a much finer fluid mesh, using

\code
tetgen -a0.05 fsi_bifurcation_fluid.poly
\endcode

The resulting tetgen <code>*.ele</code>,  <code>*.node</code> and
<code>*.face</code> files can be used with same driver code.


@I w 0.75\textwidth finer_fluid_mesh "Solution computed with a finer fluid mesh. "

As an \b exercise, generate some finer fluid and solid meshes yourself
and confirm that they may be used without having to change the driver
code.

<HR>


\subsection go_wrong What can go wrong?
Here are a few things that can (and often do) go wrong in
unstructured, three-dimensional FSI problems. 
- <b>The facets that define the FSI boundary don't match:</b> \n\n
  This tends to happen if the <code>*.poly</code> files 
  describing the fluid and solid meshes do not use
  the same facets to describe the FSI interface. While we
  do not expect the fluid and solid meshes themselves
  to match, the representation of the FSI interface via
  facets \c must be consistent. A simple way to ensure consistency 
  is to use the following procedure:
  \n\n
  -# Write the <code>*.poly</code> file for the fluid mesh.
     Make sure that each facet is given a separate boundary ID
     (at least for the facets describing the FSI interface). 
     \n\n
  -# Solve a single-physics fluids problem on this mesh to check the
     integrity of the mesh -- the solution of this problem will
     also give you some insight into the expected flow field.
     \n\n
  -# Make a copy of the <code>*.poly</code> file for the fluid mesh
     and modify it to describe the solid mesh, leaving the facets
     that define the FSI interface unchanged. This automatically
     ensures that the representation of the FSI boundary from the
     fluid's and the solid's point of view is consistent.
     \n\n
  -# Solve a single-physics solids problem on this mesh to check the
     integrity of the mesh, e.g. by applying some pressure loading on 
     the future FSI boundary  -- the solution of this problem will
     also give you some insight into the expected wall deformation.
     \n\n
  -# Couple the two problems, as shown in this tutorial.
     \n\n
  .
  As an \b exercise, modify the tetgen <code>*.poly</code> files
  and the driver code so that it can handle the extended domain
  considered in the 
  <a href="../../../navier_stokes/unstructured_three_d_fluid/html/index.html#finer_mesh">
  single-physics fluids problem.</a>

- <b> An FSI (sub-)boundary is not planar:</b> \n\n
  In an unstructured mesh, the FSI boundary will usually be 
  represented by a large number of distinct mesh boundaries. 
  The automatic setup of the boundary coordinates on these
  mesh boundaries requires them to be (individually) planar -- at least in the
  problem's initial configuration. Provided you have followed our advice
  and associated each of the facets that define the FSI boundary 
  with a different boundary ID, you should not have any problems as
  \c tetgen does not allow non-planar facets.
  \n\n
- <b> The solver does not converge:</b> \n\n
  A large-displacement FSI problem is a highly nonlinear problem and the
  provision of a good initial guess for the Newton iteration
  is essential. We tend to proceed as follows:
  \n\n
  -# Follow the steps outlined above, to study the constituent
     single-physics problems first. This will already give you
     some insight into the behaviour of the problem. For instance,
     the solution of the single-physics Navier-Stokes equations at 
     the desired Reynolds number may have to be computed via a parameter
     incrementation, starting from Stokes flow. Similarly, the
     study of the single-physics solid problem will reveal what
     load increments can be accommodated without causing the
     Newton iteration to diverge.
     \n\n
  -# Combine the two single-physics problems 
     using the steps described in this tutorial. 
     \n\n
  -# Switch off the fluid-structure interaction by 
     \n\n
     -# setting the FSI parameter to zero, \f$ Q = 0, \f$ 
     \n\n
     -# commenting out the call to 
        \c FSI_functions::setup_fluid_load_info_for_solid_elements(...),
     \n\n
     -# not creating the Lagrange-multiplier elements that
        enforce the solid displacements onto the fluid mesh.
     .
     \n\n
     This completely uncouples the two problems, although they will be
     solved simultaneously, allowing you
     to replicate the single-physics parameter studies already
     performed. 
     \n\n
  -# Now switch on the various interactions, one-by-one, while
     carefully validating the results at each stage. We tend to 
     proceed as follows:
     \n\n
     -# Solve the uncoupled problem at zero Reynolds number.
        \n\n
     -# Increase the Reynolds number in small increments to its
        target value.
        \n\n
     -# Re-enable the call to 
        \c FSI_functions::setup_fluid_load_info_for_solid_elements(...)
        and attach the Lagrange multiplier elements but keep 
        \f$ Q = 0. \f$ If the solid is not loaded by any 
        forces/tractions other than those arising from the fluid,
        the solution should not change as the solid remains unloaded.
        \n\n
     -# Gently increase the value of the FSI parameter, \f$ Q \f$,
        remembering that it represents the ratio of the typical
        viscous fluid stresses to the stiffness of the solid.
        Hence, even relatively small values of \f$ Q \f$
        tend to lead to relatively large solid displacements. 
        Be gentle!
