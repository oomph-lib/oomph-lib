\mainpage Example problem: The generalised Helmholtz equation and the use of perfectly matched layers


 
In this document we discuss the finite-element-based solution of a
generalised form of the Helmholtz equation, an elliptic PDE that 
describes time-harmonic wave propagation  problems. Compared to the
"standard form" of the Helmholtz equation, discussed in
<a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html">
another tutorial,</a> the formulation used here allows the
for the presence of damping and also allows the
imposition of the Sommerfeld radiation condition by means of 
so-called  "perfectly matched layers" (PMLs) as an alternative 
to classical absorbing/approximate boundary conditions or DtN maps.

We start by  reviewing the relevant theory and then 
present the solution of a simple model problem -- the outward propagation of
waves from the surface of a cylinder.

\section theory Theory: The Helmholtz equation for time-harmonic scattering problems
The Helmholtz equation governs time-harmonic solutions of problems
governed by the linear wave equation
\f[
\nabla( c^2 \nabla U(x,y,t)) = \frac{\partial^2 U(x,y,t)}{\partial t^2},
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[lin_wave]@
\f]
where \f$ c \f$ is the wavespeed. Assuming that \f$ U(x,y,t) \f$
is time-harmonic, with frequency \f$ \omega \f$, we write the real
function \f$ U(x,y,t) \f$ as
\f[
U(x,y,t) =Re (u(x,y) \ e^{-i \omega t})
\f]
where \f$ u(x,y) \f$ is complex-valued. If the wavespeed is constant 
this transforms  (@R[lin_wave]@) into the 
<a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html">
standard form of the Helmholtz equation</a>
\f[
\nabla^2 u(x,y) + k^2 u(x,y) = 0
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[helmholtz]@
\f]
where 
\f[
k = \frac{\omega}{c}
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[wavenumber]@
\f]
is the wave number. Like other elliptic PDEs the Helmholtz equation
admits Dirichlet, Neumann (flux) and Robin boundary conditions.

If the equation is solved in an infinite domain (e.g. in scattering
problems) the solution must satisfy the so-called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommerfeld_radiation_condition">
Sommerfeld radiation condition</a> which in 2D has the form
\f[
\lim_{r\to \infty} \sqrt{r} \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} - iku
\right) =0. 
\f]
Mathematically, this condition is required to ensure the uniqueness
of the solution (and hence the well-posedness of the problem).
In a physical context, such as a scattering problem, the condition 
ensures that scattering of an incoming wave only produces outgoing not 
incoming waves from infinity.

Here we generalise the above formulation by allowing for
- the presence of damping
- spatial variation of the wave-speed and damping
.
by writing the wavenumber as
\f[
k(x,y) = \frac{\omega}{c(x,y)} + i \alpha(x,y).
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[newwavenumber]@
\f]
where \f$ \alpha \f$ is a measure of the absorption/damping of the
medium in which the wave propagates.

The complex wavenumber couples real and imaginary parts of the
solution, \f$ u_R\f$ and \f$ u_I\f$, respectively,
and the governing equation now becomes
 \f[
 \nabla (c^2 \nabla) (u_R + i u_I) + 
(\omega^2 - \alpha^2 c^2 + i 2 \alpha \omega c) (u_R + i u_I) = 0,
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[newhelmholtz]@
\f]

which can be decomposed into real and imaginary part as

 \f[
 \nabla(c^2 \nabla) u_R + (\omega^2 - \alpha^2 c^2) u_R - 2 \alpha \omega c u_I 
+ i [\nabla (c^2 \nabla)u_I + 2 \alpha \omega c u_R + (\omega^2 -
\alpha^2 c^2) u_I] = 0.
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[separatedhelmholtz]@
\f]

\section discr Discretisation by finite elements
The discretisation of the Helmholtz equation itself only requires a trivial
modification of \c oomph-lib's Helmholtz elements -- we simply rewrite
the terms containing  \f$ k \f$ in
terms of \f$ \omega \f$,  \f$ c \f$  and  \f$ \alpha \f$. Since most practical 
applications
of the Helmholtz equation involve complex-valued solutions, we provide 
separate storage for the real and imaginary parts of the solution -- 
each \c Node therefore stores two unknowns values. By default,
the real and imaginary parts are stored as values 0 and 1,
respectively; see the section \ref numbering for details. 

The application of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is 
straightforward:
- Dirichlet conditions are imposed by pinning the relevant nodal
  values and setting them to the appropriate prescribed values. 
- Neumann (flux) boundary conditions are imposed via 
  \c FaceElements (here the \c GeneralisedHelmholtzFluxElements). 
   <a href="../../../poisson/two_d_poisson_flux_bc/html/index.html">
  As usual</a> we attach these to the faces of the "bulk" elements
  that are subject to the Neumann boundary conditions.
.

The imposition of the Sommerfeld radiation condition for problems in
infinite domains is slightly more complicated. 
<a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html">
Another tutorial</a> shows how to impose this condition by
means of absorbing/approximate boundary conditions or DtN maps.
In the next section we will discuss an alternative approach to this
problem by means of perfectly matched layers.

\subsection pml Perfectly matched layers

The idea behind perfectly matched layers is illustrated in the
figure below. The actual physical/mathematical problem 
has to be solved in the infinite domain \f$ D \f$ (shown on the left), 
with the Sommerfeld radiation condition ensuring the suitable decay 
of the solution at large distances from the region of interest 
(the vicinity of the scatterer, say).

If computations are performed in a finite computational domain, \f$
D_c \f$ , (shown in the middle), spurious wave reflections are likely to  
be generated at the artificial boundary \f$
\partial D_c \f$ of the computational domain.

The idea behind PML methods is to surround the actual computational
domain \f$ D_c \f$ with a layer of "absorbing" material whose
properties are chosen such that the outgoing waves are absorbed 
within it, without creating any artificial reflected waves at the interface
between the PML layer and the computational domain.


@I w 0.75\textwidth pml "Sketch illustrating the idea behind perfectly matched layers. "

Our implementation of the perfectly matched layers follows the
development in 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999106004487">
A. Bermudez, L. Hervella-Nieto, A. Prieto, and 
R. Rodriguez "An optimal perfectly matched layer with unbounded 
absorbing function for time-harmonic acoustic scattering problems"
Journal of Computational Physics <b>223</b> 469-488 (2007)</a>
and we assume the boundaries of the computational domain to be aligned
with the coordinate axes, as shown in the sketch above.

The method requires a slight further generalisation of the equations, 
achieved by introducing the complex coordinate mapping 
\f[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \to \frac{1}{\gamma_j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} 
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[cctransform]@
\f]
within the perfectly matched layers. This makes the problem
anisotropic and in 2D we have
 \f[
 \nabla(c^2 \nabla) u = 
\frac{1}{\gamma_x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( c^2
\frac{1}{\gamma_x}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right) + 
\frac{1}{\gamma_y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( c^2 
\frac{1}{\gamma_y}\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)
 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ @E[pml2]@
\f]

The choice of \f$ \gamma_x \f$  and 
\f$ \gamma_y \f$ depends on the orientation of the 
PML layer. Since we are restricting ourselves to axis-aligned
mesh boundaries we need to distinguish three different cases, as 
shown in the sketch below:


@I w 0.75\textwidth pml_meshes "Sketch illustrating the geometry of the perfectly matched layers. "

- For layers that are aligned with the y axis (such as the left
  and right PML layers in the sketch) we set 
  \f[
  \gamma_{x}(x)  = 
  1 +\frac{i}{\omega/c+i  \alpha}\ \sigma_{x}(x) 
  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{ \ \ \ with \ \ \ }
  \sigma_{x}(x)  =  \frac{1}{|X_{PML}-x|}, \ \ \ \ \ 
  @E[absorbingfctx]@
  \f] 
  where \f$ X_{PML} \f$ is the x-coordinate of the outer boundary
  of the PML layer, and
  \f[
   \gamma_y = 1.
  \f] 
- For layers that are aligned with the x axis  (such as the top
  and bottom PML layers in the sketch) we set 
  \f[ 
  \gamma_x = 1,
  \f] 
  and
  \f[
  \gamma_{y}(y) = 
  1+\frac{i}{\omega/c+i \alpha} \ \sigma_{y}(y) 
  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{ \ \ \ with \ \ \ }
  \sigma_{y}(y)  =  \frac{1}{|Y_{PML}-y|}, \ \ \ \ \ 
  @E[absorbingfcty]@
  \f]
  where \f$ Y_{PML} \f$ is the y-coordinate of the outer boundary
  of the PML layer.
- In corner regions that are bounded by two axis-aligned PML layers
  (with outer coordinates \f$ X_{PML} \f$ and  
  \f$ Y_{PML} \f$) we set
  \f[
  \gamma_{x}(x)  = 
  1 +\frac{i}{\omega/c+i  \alpha}\ \sigma_{x}(x) 
  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{ \ \ \ with \ \ \ }
  \sigma_{x}(x)  =  \frac{1}{|X_{PML}-x|} \ \ \ \ \ 
  @E[absorbingfctx_corner]@
  \f]
  and
  \f[
  \gamma_{y}(y) = 
  1+\frac{i}{\omega/c+i \alpha} \ \sigma_{y}(y) 
  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{ \ \ \ with \ \ \ }
  \sigma_{y}(y)  =  \frac{1}{|Y_{PML}-y|}. \ \ \ \ \ 
  @E[absorbingfcty_corner]@
  \f]
- Finally, in the actual computational domain (outside
  the PML layers) we set
  \f[
  \gamma_{x}(x) =   \gamma_{y}(y) = 1.
  \f]
.

\subsection impl Implementation of the perfectly matched layers within oomph-lib

The finite-element-discretised equations (@R[separatedhelmholtz]@)
(modified by the PML terms discussed above) are implemented in 
the \c GeneralisedHelmholtzEquations<DIM> class which is templated
by the spatial dimension, \c DIM.  As usual, we provide 
fully functional elements by combining these with geometric
finite elements (from the Q and T families -- corresponding (in 2D)
to triangles and quad elements). By default, the PML modifications
are disabled, i.e.  \f$ \gamma_{x}(x) \f$ and \f$ \gamma_{y}(y) \f$ are both
set to 1.

  The generation of suitable 2D PML meshes along the axis-aligned
boundaries of a given bulk mesh is facilitated by helper
functions which automatically erect layers of (quadrilateral)
PML elements. The layers are built from 
\c QGeneralisedHelmholtzElement<2,NNODE_1D> elements and
the parameter \c NNODE_1D is automatically chosen to match that of
the elements in the bulk mesh. The bulk mesh can contain quads or triangles
(as shown in the specific example presented below).

For instance, to erect a PML layer (of width \c width, with \c n_pml elements
across the width of the layer) on the "right" boundary 
(with boundary ID \c b_bulk) of the bulk mesh pointed to by \c
bulk_mesh_pt, a call to 
\code
PMLHelper::create_right_pml_mesh(bulk_mesh_pt, b_bulk, n_pml, width);
\endcode
returns a pointer to a newly-created mesh that contains the 
PML elements which are automatically attached to the 
boundary of the bulk mesh (i.e. the \c Nodes on the
outer boundary of the bulk mesh are shared (pointed to), rather than
duplicated, by the
elements in the PML mesh). The PML-ness of the elements is
automatically enabled, i.e. the functions \f$ \gamma_x(x) \f$
and \f$ \gamma_y(y) \f$ are set as described above. Finally,
zero Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the real and
imaginary parts of the solution on the outer boundary of the 
PML layer.

Similar helper functions exist for PML layers on other axis-aligned
boundaries, and for corner PML meshes; see the code listings
provided below. Currently, we only provide this functionality for 
convex 2D computational domains, but the generalisation to non-convex 
boundaries and 3D is straightforward (if tedious) to implement 
(Any volunteers?).

\section scattering A specific example: Outward propagation of acoustic waves from the surface of a cylindrical object

We will now demonstrate the methodology for a specific example:
the propagation of axisymmetric waves from the surface of a
circular disk. This is a good test case because any deviations from the
axisymmetry of the (exact) solution by spurious reflections
from the boundaries of the computational domain are easy to 
detect visually.


The specific domain used in this case can be seen in the figure below.
We create an unstructured mesh of six-noded \c TGeneralisedHelmholtzElements
to create the finite computational domain surrounding a circular disk.
This is surrounded by four axis-aligned PML layers and four
corner meshes (each made of nine-noded \c QGeneralisedHelmholtzElements).

\section results Results
The figures below show the real part of the solution \f$ Re(u(x,y,t)) \f$
radiating from a circular disk with a radius of \f$ r=0.1 \f$
for the case when the non-zero Dirichlet boundary conditions are 
imposed only on the real part of \f$ u \f$ by setting
\f[
Re(u(x,y))\bigg|_{\partial D} = 0.1 \ \ \ \ \ and  \ \ \ \ 
Im(u(x,y))\bigg|_{\partial D} = 0.
\f]

@I w 0.6\textwidth Soln2D "Sample solution with activated perfectly matched layers. "

@I w 0.6\textwidth SolnHeight "Sample solution with activated perfectly matched layers -- height view. "

From the two images, one can notice the clean circular solution across
the domain. Had the perfectly matched layers not been effective,
numerical artifacts would have been observed throughout the domain. 

This is demonstrated by the following two figures which show the solution
obtained without the PML layers (and "do-nothing" (zero-flux) boundary
conditions on the outer boundaries of the computational domain).
The spurious reflections from the boundaries completely
dominate the solution which bears no resemblance to the exact
solution.

\subsection namespace The global namespace

As usual, we define the problem parameters in a global namespace.
The main physical parameters are the frequency \f$ \omega \f$, the

The driver code is very straightforward. We start by building the
\c Problem object, using six-noded triangular generalised Helmholtz
elements:

\dontinclude unstructured_two_d_helmholtz.cc
\skipline start_of_main
\until  {
\skipline Set up the problem with 2D six-node

Next we define the output directory.

\subsection class The problem class

The problem class is very similar to that employed for 
the <a href="../../../helmholtz/scattering/html/index.html">
solution of the 2D Helmholtz equation with flux boundary
conditions.</a> We provide helper functions to create the
PML meshes and to apply the boundary conditions (mainly
because these tasks have to be performed repeatedly in

\until  inner_circle_pt

and define the polygonal outer boundary of the computational domain.

\until outer_boundary_pt = new TriangleMeshPolygon(outer_boundary_line_pt);

Next we define the curvilinear inner boundary in terms of two
\c TriangleMeshCurviLines which define the hole in the domain:

We create the PML meshes and add them (and the bulk mesh) 
to the Problem's collection of sub-meshes and build the global mesh.

\skipline Create the main triangular mesh

Next we pass the problem parameters to all elements (remember that
even the elements in the PML layers need to be told about these
since they adjust the \f$ \gamma_x \f$ and \f$ \gamma_y \f$
functions in terms of these parameters), apply the boundary

\section comm_ex Comments and Exercises
\subsection numbering The enumeration of the unknowns
As discussed in the introduction, most practically relevant
solutions of the Helmholtz equation are complex valued. Since \c oomph-lib's 
solvers only deal with real (double precision) unknowns, the equations
are separated into their real and imaginary parts.
In the implementation of the Helmholtz elements, we store the real
and imaginary parts of the solution as two separate values at each 
node. By default, the real and imaginary parts are accessible via 
\c Node::value(0) and \c Node::value(1). However, 
to facilitate the use of the elements
in multi-physics problems we avoid accessing the unknowns
directly in this manner but provide the virtual function
\code
std::complex<unsigned> HelmholtzEquations<DIM>::u_index_helmholtz()
\endcode
which returns a complex number made of the two unsigneds that indicate
which nodal value represents the real and imaginary parts of the solution.
This function may be overloaded in combined multi-physics elements
in which a Helmholtz element is combined (by multiple inheritance) 
with another element, using the strategy described in 
<a href="../../../multi_physics/b_convection/html/index.html">
the Boussinesq convection tutorial</a>.

\subsection dampingfct PML damping functions
The choice for the absorbing functions in our implementation of
the PMLs is not unique. There are alternatives varying in both order and
continuity properties. The current form is the result of several
feasibility studies and comparisons found in both
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999106004487">
Bermudez et al.</a>
and in the relevant papers on 
<a href="http://imperial.academia.edu/RaduCimpeanu/Papers">Radu
Cimpeanu's webpage</a>. These damping functions produce an 
acceptable result in most practical situations without further 
modifications. For very specific applications, alternatives may 
need to be used and can easily be implemented within the
existing framework.

<HR>

\subsection ex Exercises
\subsubsection pmlsize Changing perfectly matched layer parameters
Confirm that only a very small number of PML elements (across the thickness
of the PML layer) is required to effectively damp the outgoing waves.
Furthermore, show that (and try to explain why) PMLs with too many 
elements may not perform as expected. 

A second parameter
that can be adjusted is the geometrical thickness of the perfectly matched
layers. Relative thin layers layer tend to perform better than thick layers
with few elements across their width. Confirm this and try to 
find an explanation for the phenomenon, given the form of the 
absorbing functions used in the complex coordinate transformation.

\subsubsection inhomogeneous Inhomogeneous material properties
Our generalised form the Helmholtz equations allows for 
spatially varying material parameters (wavespeed and damping). 
Explore this and examine how the perfectly matched layers behave
in such problems.


\subsubsection large_k Large wavenumbers
For Helmholtz problems in general, ill-conditioning appears as the 
wavenumber becomes very large. By altering wavespeed and/or frequency, 
explore the limitations of both the mesh and the solver in terms 
of this parameter. Try adjusting the target element size in order to alleviate
resolution-related effects. Assess the effectiveness of the perfectly matched
layers in high wavenumber problems.

\subsubsection adaptivity Spatial adaptivity
The driver code discussed above already contains the straightforward
modifications required to enable spatial adaptivity. Explore this 
(by recompiling the code with -DADAPTIVE) and explain why spatial
adaptivity is not particularly helpful for the test problem
discussed above.

\subsubsection diff_order Linear and cubic finite elements
The driver code also contains (commented out) modifications
that allow the simulation to be performed with 
three-node (linear) and ten-node (cubic) triangles. Explore the
performance of these elements and confirm that the helper functions
correctly create matching (four-node and sixteen-node) quad elements 
in the PML layers.

\subsubsection default Default values for problem parameters
Following our usual convention, we provide default values
for problem parameters where this is sensible. For instance,
if the pointer to the damping function is not set, we assume
that there is no damping, i.e. \f$ \alpha(x,y)=0. \f$
Some parameters, such as the wavespeed \f$ c \f$ and the frequency
\f$ \omega \f$, do need to be set since there are no obvious
defaults. If \c oomph-lib is compiled in \c PARANOID mode,
an error is thrown if the relevant pointers haven't been set. 
Without paranoia, you get a segmentation fault...

Confirm that this is the case by commenting out the relevant
assignments.

\subsubsection non_convex Non-convex PML boundaries
As discussed above, we currently provide helper functions to 
attach PML layers to axis-aligned boundaries of 2D meshes with
convex outer boundaries. Essentially, this restricts us to 
rectangular computational domains. Extend this capability by developing
methodologies to 
- deal with non-convex domain boundaries. We suggest you
  create PML meshes for the non-convex corners first, then
  create the axis-aligned meshes (note that these have to 
  share nodes with the already-created elements that occupy the
  non-convex corners), and then create the corner meshes
  for the convex corners (as before). When you're done, let
  us know -- this would be a really useful addition to
  oomph-lib's machinery. We're happy to help!
- Repeat the same exercise in 3D -- somewhat less trivial
  (so we're even keener for somebody to have a go!)
