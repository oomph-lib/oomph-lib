\mainpage Demo problem: Inflation of a blood vessel


The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate the simulation of
cardiovascular solid mechanics problems with \c oomph-lib. We showed in
<a href="../../../meshes/mesh_from_vmtk/html/index.html">another tutorial</a> 
how to use <a href="http://www.vmtk.org">VMTK</a>
together with \c oomph-lib's conversion code

</CENTER>
to generate unstructured fluid and solid meshes for the simulation 
of physiological fluid-structure interaction problems based on data from 
medical images. Here we show how to study the deformation of the 
vessel wall (which was assumed to have a constant thickness when
the solid mesh was generated from the imaging data) when subjected to a
pressure loading. The problem serves as a "warm-up problem" for the
<a href="../../../interaction/vmtk_fsi/html/index.html">
corresponding fluid-structure interaction problem </a> in which the elastic
vessel conveys (and is loaded by) a viscous fluid.
 
We stress that the tutorial focuses on the implementation 
aspects, not the actual physics. Since the driver code discussed
here is also used in the library's self-tests we
deliberately use a very coarse mesh and apply very simplistic
boundary conditions.  The results shown below are therefore unlikely 
to bear much resemblance to the actual deformation of a blood
vessel \e in \e vivo. The section \ref comm_ex at the end of this
tutorial provides several suggestions on how to make the simulation
more realistic.

\section problem The problem (and results)
Here is an animation of the problem: An elastic blood vessel
is loaded by an internal pressure while its "ends" are held in 
a fixed position. As the magnitude of the pressure load is
increased the vessel inflates: 


@I w 0.75\textwidth inflating_iliac "An elastic blood vessel, loaded  by an internal pressure. "


The blue frame surrounding the vessel is drawn to clarify
its spatial orientation. The yellow edges show the boundaries of the
internal faces via which the pressure loading is applied, and the
red arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of the pressure loading.

\section driver The driver code

The driver code is practically identical to the one discussed in 
<a href="../../unstructured_three_d_solid/html/index.html">
another tutorial.</a> In fact, the two codes only differ
in the specification of the names of the tetgen files that describe the
unstructured fluid mesh, and the enumeration of the boundaries. 
We also disabled the gravitational body force. 
Therefore, we will not discuss the driver code in detail.

\section comm_ex Comments and Exercises

\subsection finer Generating finer meshes
As acknowledged at the beginning of the tutorial, the solid mesh
is far too coarse for the simulation results to be accurate. 
As an exercise, follow the instructions in \c oomph-lib's 
<a href="../../../meshes/mesh_from_vmtk/html/index.html">VMTK tutorial</a>
to generate a finer mesh. We are hoping to make the image files
used in this tutorial available soon. Please 
<a href="../../../contact/html/index.html">contact us</a>
if you can't wait. Remember that you will have to update the 
enumeration of the domain boundaries if you change the mesh.

\subsection bc Making the boundary conditions more "realistic"
In the example shown above we applied boundary conditions that held 
the "ends" of the bifurcation in a fixed position. These boundary
conditions are obviously rather artificial as no such constraints
exist in the human body. Unfortunately, it is not entirely clear
how to come up with boundary conditions that are genuinely "more 
realistic". One 
way to ensure that the (inevitably artificial) boundary conditions
have a weak(er) effect on the deformation of the "region of interest"
would be to attach "flow extensions" to the in- and outflow
cross-sections, using the technique described in \c oomph-lib's
<a href="../../../meshes/mesh_from_vmtk/html/index.html#add_extensions">
VMTK tutorial.</a>
Alternatively, we could constrain the displacement of a much smaller 
number of material points -- rigid body motions can be suppressed by 
pinning the position of just three nodes. We encourage you to
explore these options yourself.
