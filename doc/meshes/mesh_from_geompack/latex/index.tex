In this document we demonstrate how to generate quadrilateral {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} meshes, based on the output from Barry Joe\textquotesingle{}s mesh generator \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++}, }} available as freeware at \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ http\+://members.\+shaw.\+ca/bjoe/.}} The mesh generation is performed in a two-\/stage process. First we use \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} to generate the mesh \char`\"{}offline\char`\"{}. Then we process the output files generated by ~\newline
 \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} to generate an {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} mesh.

The documents {\ttfamily meshoper.\+pdf} and {\ttfamily regmesh.\+pdf} distributed with \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} contain a comprehensive User\textquotesingle{}s Guide for the code and its many options. \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} is a very sophisticated mesh generator and can be used to create 2D and 3D meshes with a wide variety of element types. Here we only discuss how to use \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} to generate 2D quadrilateral meshes. \mbox{[}The development of of {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} meshes that process \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++\textquotesingle{}s} }} output for other element types should be straightforward but is still on our \char`\"{}\+To Do\char`\"{} list -- any volunteers?\mbox{]}

\href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} creates quadrilateral meshes, based on the information about the mesh boundaries (nodes and curves) provided in two input files, {\ttfamily filename.\+rg2} and {\ttfamily filename.\+cs2}, say. An output file, {\ttfamily filename.\+1.\+mh2} is created. It contains the information about the mesh boundaries, the nodal positions and the element connectivity lists.

\hypertarget{index_geomview}{}\doxysubsection{How to visualise a mesh generated by Geompack++}\label{index_geomview}
To visualise the mesh, the program {\ttfamily Geomview} is available. ({\ttfamily Geomview} can be downloaded from the \href{http://www.geomview.org/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geomview} home page }}.) The \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} output file cannot be processed directly by \href{http://www.geomview.org/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geomview} }} but a simple program that converts the file {\ttfamily filename.\+mh2} to a format that is readable by \href{http://www.geomview.org/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geomview} }} is \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/convert_geom_file.cc}{\texttt{ available.}}

\hypertarget{index_example}{}\doxysubsection{The example\+: A rectangle with a hole}\label{index_example}
As an example we demonstrate how to use \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} to generate a mesh for the rectangular domain with a hole shown in the figure below. The domain is defined by eight nodes and eight curves (straight lines) which connect the nodes and define two boundaries. ~\newline
 The boundary numbers shown in the sketch correspond to those in the \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++} }} input region file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.rg2}{\texttt{ box\+\_\+hole.\+rg2 }} and in the curve input file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.cs2}{\texttt{ box\+\_\+hole.\+cs2.}} In the corresponding {\ttfamily oomph-\/lib} mesh, the boundaries are numbered from zero.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{box_hole_2}
\doxyfigcaption{A rectangular domain with a hole. }
\end{DoxyImage}


The desired mesh characteristics are defined in the file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.m2}{\texttt{ box\+\_\+hole.\+m2}} which specifies that the final mesh should contain approximately 200 elements. When processed with the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./geompack++ box\_hole.m2 error.log}

\end{DoxyCode}
 \href{http://members.shaw.ca/bjoe/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Geompack++ }}} creates the output file \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/box_hole.mh2}{\texttt{ box\+\_\+hole.\+mh2.}}

Here is a sketch of the resulting discretisation, as displayed by {\ttfamily geomview} \+:

 The driver code \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/mesh_from_geompack_poisson.cc}{\texttt{ mesh\+\_\+from\+\_\+geompack\+\_\+poisson.\+cc}} demonstrates the use of this mesh for the solution of a 2D Poisson problem in the \char`\"{}rectangular domain with a hole\char`\"{}, described in the previous section.

 The names of these files are then passed to the mesh constructor. Since the rest of the \href{../../../../demo_drivers/meshing/mesh_from_geompack/mesh_from_geompack_poisson.cc}{\texttt{ driver code }} is identical to that in the \href{../../../../doc/poisson/two_d_poisson/html/index.html}{\texttt{ corresponding example with a structured mesh}}, we do not provide a detailed code listing but simply show the plot of the computed results, together with the tanh-\/shaped exact solution of the problem\+:
