\mainpage Demo problem: The (axisymmetric) static free surface bounding a layer of viscous fluid.

\section overview Overview of the problem

 We consider an open circular container of unit radius
 containing a still viscous fluid of
 prescribed volume \f$ \mathcal{V} \f$ 
 that meets the wall of the container at a contact
 angle \f$ \theta_{c} \f$. The problem is extremely similar to that
 described in the  
 <a href="../../../navier_stokes/static_single_layer/html/index.html">
 two-dimensional static cap tutorial. </a>  The exact solution
 corresponds to a free surface of constant curvature that 
 is the arc of a circle
 rotated about the axis to give a section of a sphere. 
 The mean curvature of
 the interface in this problem is  \f$ \kappa = 2/r = 4\cos\theta_{c}
 \f$, which differs from the two-dimensional problem in which it was \f$
 2\cos\theta_{c} \f$.

 The only differences between the axisymmetric and the 
 <a href="../../../navier_stokes/static_single_layer/html/index.html">
 two-dimensional </a> driver codes are that:
-# two-dimensional elements are replaced by the equivalent axisymmeric elements;\n
-# specified volume is different;\n
-# swirl (theta) component of velocity is pinned; \n
-# analytic pressure drop is changed. \n
.

In other words we make the following changes:

\section comments Comments and Exercises

\subsection com Comments

- The formula for the specified volume in the axisymmetric
case is the true volume \f$ \mathcal{V} \f$ divided by \f$ 2\pi \f$ because 
all the axisymmetric equations are divided by the common factor 
of \f$ 2 \pi \f$. The \c AxisymmetricVolumeConstraintBoundingElement
class must be used so that the volume is correctly calculated.

- The swirl velocity is pinned on the boundaries by including the
additional code
\code
   Bulk_mesh_pt->boundary_node_pt(b,n)->pin(2);
\endcode
.

\subsection exercises Exercises

-# Confirm that the computed pressure differences agree with the
   analytic expression. Verify that the interface shape is unaffected
   by the capillary number, but that the pressure difference
   across the interface changes in inverse proportion to it. Check
   that the pressure difference is unaffected by the choice of
   reference pressure.\n\n
-# Investigate what happens when the two-dimensional volume constraint
   elements are used. Explain your result. \n\n
