#
#  NOTE: Options need to go first!
#
# A few options:    [type ./configure --help to see the full list] 
# --------------
#
#         --enable-MPI   includes all MPI sources into the build
#                        (you will probably have to specify
#                        your MPI libraries and include directories
#                        in the compiler/linker options; see the 
#                        examples enclosed below).
#         --enable-suppress-doc  Don't build the documentation (can take a long
#                        and uses quite a bit of diskspace. You might
#                        prefer to consult the online documentation at
#                        http://www.oomph-lib.org
#         --enable-suppress-demo Don't build the demo codes/self test  
#
# Common compiler/linker flags:
# -----------------------------            
#
# - CXX =  C++ compiler (defaults to gcc/g++ if not specified)
# - CC  =  C compiler (defaults to gcc if not specified)
# - F77 =  F77 compiler (defaults to gcc/g77 if not specified)
# 
# - CXXFLAGS = flags for the C++ compiler. Specify optmisation flags
#              for your compiler (e.g. -O3 for maximum optimisation
#              with the gcc compiler suite, enable debugging (-g for
#              the gcc compilers), etc.)
#
#              Here's a list of useful oomph-lib related flags:
#              
#              -DPARANOID enables "general paranoia", allowing the
#                         code to perform various sanity checks
#                         during execution. Incurs a moderate run-time
#                         overhead.
#              -DRANGE_CHECKING switches on bounds checking in
#                         oomph-lib's Vector class (a wrapper to the
#                         the STL vector class). This is VERY costly
#                         in terms of run time but very useful for
#                         tracking down the source of otherwise
#                         inexcplicable segmentation faults...
#              -DLEAK_CHECK mainly used during code developement. Used
#                         to allow optional checks that objects are 
#                         deleted to avoid memory leaks.
#              -DWARN_ABOUT_SUBTLY_CHANGED_OOMPH_INTERFACES throws
#                         an oomph-lib warning whenever a function
#                         whose interface has been changed "subtly"
#                         (i.e. in a way that the compiler can't detect,
#                         e.g. a change in the order of two arguments
#                         of the same type) during some revision is called.
#                         Use this only (!) if your code behaves
#                         oddly after upgrading to a newer release
#                         of the library.
# 
# - CFLAGS   = flags for the C compiler. Specify optimisation flags
#              for your compiler (e.g. -O3 for maximum optimisation
#              with the gcc compiler suite, enable debugging (-g for
#              the gcc compilers), etc.) The C-compiler is only used
#              to compile certain external libraries, such as superlu.
#              Therefore it is not necessary to specify any of 
#              oomph-lib's own compilation flags.
# 
# - FFLAGS   = flags for the f77 compiler. Specify optimisation flags
#              for your compiler (e.g. -O3 for maximum optimisation
#              with the gcc compiler suite, enable debugging (-g for
#              the gcc compilers), etc.) The f77-compiler is only used
#              to compile certain external libraries, such as the
#              frontal solver from the hsl library.
#              Therefore it is not necessary to specify any of 
#              oomph-lib's own compilation flags.
#
# - FFLAGS_NO_OPT   = flags for the f77 compiler without optimisation, 
#              required for a couple of files in the BLAS library.
#              Usually the flag is -O0, but you may wish/need to pass other
#              flags as well. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to do this 
#              automatically so you have to do it yourself, sorry. In almost
#              all cases you can copy FFLAGS and replace -O3 with -O0.
#
# - LIBS     = Specify any additional libraries that you might have
#              to link against -- typically only required if  mpi is
#              used. autoconf should automatically detect any 
#              other libraries.
