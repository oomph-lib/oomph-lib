## Description

Please consult the file [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) in this directory for
installation instructions.

The [`oomph-lib` homepage](http://www.oomph-lib.org) provides much more detail on
installation instructions, tutorials, and licencing information. Provided you
have downloaded a distribution that contains the documentation and you have the
required tools (mainly `doxygen`; get it from [here](http://www.doxygen.org))
available on your machine, the installation procedure will create a local copy
of the `oomph-lib` webpages and the entire online documentation in the `doc`
directory. In particular, `doc/html/index.html` is a local copy of the `oomph-lib`
homepage.

To learn more about contributing to `oomph-lib`, please see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) which contains a detailed description of 
the workflow.


## Community

The original "architects" of `oomph-lib` (in alphabetical order) are
[**Andrew Hazel**](https://github.com/alhazel) (**co-founder**) &
[**Matthias Heil**](https://github.com/MatthiasHeilManchester) (**co-founder**).
Alongside the library founders, `oomph-lib` is currently maintained with the
help of [**Jonathan Deakin**](https://github.com/jondea) and
[**Puneet Matharu**](https://github.com/PuneetMatharu). However, the library has
received (and is still receiving) significant contributions from former/current
project/MSc/PhD students and collaborators. For an exhaustive list, see
[`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md).
