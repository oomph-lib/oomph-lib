// Mesh builder: This builds the mesh with a specific element
// so that the mesh sources don't have to be re-compiled over
// and over again in the driver code... Useful strategy if
// the driver code is under development and uses a complicated
// mesh with long compile times

// Include Poisson elements/equations
#include "poisson.h"

// Include the full source for mesh (this is the automatically generated
// combined header file that contains the templated header and the
// templated sources)
#include "meshes/simple_rectangular_quadmesh.h"
