 /// \short A policy class that serves to establish the
 /// common interfaces for elements that contain moving nodes. This
 /// class provides storage for the geometric data that affect the
 /// update of all the nodes of the element, i.e. USUALLY
 /// all data that are using during a call
 /// to the Element's node_update() function. In some cases
 /// (e.g. FluidInterfaceEdge elements), node_update() is overloaded to
 /// perform an update of the bulk element, in which case the additional
 /// bulk geometric data become external data of the element and the
 /// function GeneralisedElement::update_in_external_fd(i) is overloaded
 /// to also perform the bulk node update.
 /// The storage is populated
 /// during the assignment of the equation numbers via the
 /// complete_setup_of_dependencies() function and then local equations
 /// numbers are assigned to these data, accessible via
 /// geometric_data_local_eqn(n,i). Finally, a function is provided
 /// that calculates the terms in the jacobian matrix by due to these
 /// geometric data by finite differences.
