  /// Displacement control element: In the "normal" formulation
  /// of solid mechanics problems, the external load is given and the
  /// displacement throughout the solid body is computed.
  /// For highly nonlinear problems it is sometimes helpful to
  /// re-formulate the problem by prescribing the position of a
  /// selected control point and treating the (scalar) load level
  /// required to achieve this deformation as an unknown.
  /// As an example consider the buckling of pressure-loaded,
  /// thin-walled elastic shells.
  /// The load-displacement characteristics of such structures tend to be highly
  /// nonlinear and bifurcations from the structure's pre-buckling state
  /// often occur via sub-critical bifurcations. If we have some
  /// a-priori knowledge of the expected deformation (for example, during the
  /// non-axisymmetric buckling of a circular cylindrical shell certain
  /// material points will be displaced radially inwards), it
  /// is advantageous to prescribe the radial displacement of a carefully
  /// selected control point and treat the external pressure as an unknown.
  ///
  /// \c DisplacementControlElements facilitate the use of
  /// such methods. They require the specification of
  /// - the control point at which the displacement is prescribed. This is
  ///   done by specifying:
  ///   - a pointer, \c controlled_element_pt, to a \c SolidFiniteElement and
  ///   - the vector \c controlled_point which contains the local
  ///     coordinates of the control point in that \c SolidFiniteElement.
  ///   .
  /// - the coordinate direction. \c controlled_direction. in which
  ///   the displacement is controlled.
  /// - a pointer to a double, \c  control_position_value_pt,
  ///   that specifies the desired value of the prescribed
  ///   coordinate after the deformation (i.e. if \c controlled_direction=1
  ///   then \c *control_position_value_pt specifies
  ///   the \f$ x_1 \f$ coordinate of the control point in the deformed
  ///   configuration.)
  /// .
  /// The \c DisplacementControlElement has two constructors:
  /// - In the first version, we pass the pointer to the \c Data object whose
  ///   one-and-only value contains the scalar load level that is "traded"
  ///   for the displacement constraint. This is appropriate if the
  ///   load \c Data has already been created (and is included in the
  ///   overall equation numbering procedure) by some other element. In that
  ///   case the  \c DisplacementControlElement treats the (already existing)
  ///   \c Data object external \c Data.
  /// - In the second version, a \c Data object (with a single value)
  ///   is created by the constructor of the \c DisplacementControlElement
  ///   and stored in its internal \c Data. Once the
  ///   \c DisplacementControlElement has been included in one of the
  ///   \c Problem's meshes, it is therefore automatically included
  ///   in the equation numbering procedure. The (pointer to) the
  ///   newly created \c Data is accessible via the access function
  ///   \c displacement_control_load_pt(). It can be used to make
  ///   make the unknown load level accessible to the load function
  ///   that drives the deformation.
  /// .
  /// \b Note: The element inherits from the BlockPreconditionableElementBase
  /// and can be used in the block-preconditioning context. The element
  /// is "in charge" of the control load (if it's been created internally)
  /// and classifies it as its one-and-only "DOF type"
