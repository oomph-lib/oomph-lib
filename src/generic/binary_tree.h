  /// BinaryTree class: Recursively defined, generalised binary tree.
  ///
  /// A BinaryTree has:
  /// - a pointer to the object (of type RefineableQElement<1>) that it
  ///   represents in a mesh refinement context.
  /// - a Vector of pointers to its two (L/R) sons (which are
  ///   themselves binary trees). If the Vector of pointers to the sons
  ///   has zero length, the BinaryTree is a "leaf node" in the overall
  ///   binary tree.
  /// - a pointer to its father. If this pointer is NULL, the BinaryTree
  ///   is the root node of the overall binary tree.
  /// This data is stored in the Tree base class.
  ///
  /// The tree can also be part of a forest. If that is the case, the root
  /// will have pointers to the roots of neighbouring binary trees.
  ///
  /// The objects contained in the binary tree are assumed to be
  /// line elements whose geometry is parametrised by local coordinates
  /// \f$ {\bf s} \in [-1,1] \f$.
  ///
  /// The tree can be traversed and actions performed at all its
  /// "nodes" or only at the leaf "nodes" ("nodes" without sons).
  ///
  /// Finally, the leaf "nodes" can be split depending on
  /// a criteria defined by the object.
  ///
  /// Note that BinaryTrees are only generated by splitting existing
  /// BinaryTrees. Therefore, the constructors are protected. The
  /// only BinaryTree that "Joe User" can create is the (derived) class
  /// BinaryTreeRoot.
