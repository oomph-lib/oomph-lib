  /// - a pointer to the object (of type RefineableQElement<2>) that it
  ///   represents in a mesh refinement context.
  /// - Vector of pointers to its four (SW/SE/NW/NE) sons (which are
  ///   themselves quadtrees).
  ///   If the Vector of pointers to the sons has zero length,
  ///   the QuadTree is a "leaf node" in the overall quadtree.
  /// - a pointer to its father. If this pointer is NULL, the QuadTree is the
  ///   the root node of the overall quadtree.
  /// This data is stored in the Tree base class.
  ///
  /// The tree can also be part of a forest. If that is the case, the root
  /// will have pointers to the roots of neighbouring quadtrees.
  ///
  /// The objects contained in the quadtree are assumed to be
  /// (topologically) rectangular elements whose geometry is
  /// parametrised by local coordinates \f$ {\bf s} \in [-1,1]^2 \f$.
  ///
  /// The tree can be traversed and actions performed
  /// at all its "nodes" or only at the leaf "nodes" ("nodes" without sons).
  ///
  /// Finally, the leaf "nodes" can be split depending on
  /// a criteria defined by the object.
  ///
  /// Note that QuadTrees are only generated by splitting existing
  /// QuadTrees. Therefore, the constructors are protected. The
  /// only QuadTree that "Joe User" can create is
  /// the (derived) class QuadTreeRoot.
